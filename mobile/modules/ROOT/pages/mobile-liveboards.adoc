Liveboards are the ThoughtSpot term for a dashboard. They group and manage related search result visuals.

What are Liveboards::
Liveboards act like live dashboards. They are collections of your related Answers, in the form of charts and tables, and your headline metrics.
Liveboard authors can pin charts and tables to any Liveboard that they create or edit. Liveboards can be shared with view privileges to mobile users.

NOTE: ThoughtSpot mobile users can view but not edit Liveboards in the mobile app.
