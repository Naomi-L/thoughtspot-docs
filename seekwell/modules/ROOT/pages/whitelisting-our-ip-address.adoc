NOTE: Some cloud providers require a "/32" after the IP address.

.SSH
====
Make sure to include the `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` at the top and the `-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` at the bottom. You cannot use an OPENSSH key (for example, one starting with `-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----` ). If you have an OPENSSH key, you can convert it to an RSA key following link:https://stackoverflow.com/a/57324123/3583139[these instructions,window=_blank].

.MySQL (manual)
====
Example using MySQL statements:

[source,ruby]
----
GRANT SELECT ON *.* to your_user_name@'35.193.207.79' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_user_password';
GRANT SELECT ON *.* to your_user_name@'35.239.74.213' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_user_password';
----

Change `your_user_name` and `your_user_password`.

Normally, you will have already granted access to your current External IP. If you have not, you will need to grant access for that as well.
