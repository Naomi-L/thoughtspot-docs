You can automatically trigger any block to run by sending a request to "https://api.seekwell.io/run_one" along with your Block ID, an API key, and optional parameters.

== Steps:

.  Open the link:https://app.seekwell.io/[web app] and hit `command` / `ctrl` + `k`, then type “API” to generate an API key.

. Go to your block that you would like to trigger programmatically, and copy the Block ID from the URL as shown below.

.  Post a request to "https://api.seekwell.io/run_one" with your Block ID, API Key, and optional parameters (example using Python link:https://pypi.org/project/requests/[Requests HTTP library]).

[source,ruby]
----
import requests

data = {
            'blockId': 'long_id_from_url_in_step_2',
            'api_key': 'api_key_from_step_1',
						'parameters': [] #optional array of parameters
        }
url = 'https://api.seekwell.io/run_one'
response = requests.post(url, json=data)
print(response.ok)
----

. (Optional) If the block you are triggering has xref:parameters.adoc[Parameters], you can set those parameters in your request JSON. In the example below, I'm sending user data to a Google Sheet based on which channel they signed up through (facebook, twitter, etc.).

The "parameters" in your request JSON should be an array of dictionaries containing the name-value pairs of each of the Parameters you want to set, as in the code below.

[source,ruby]
----
data = {
            'blockId': long_id_from_url_in_step_2,
            'api_key': api_key_from_step_1,
						'parameters': [{'name':'channel','value':'facebook'}]
        }
url = 'https://api.seekwell.io/run_one'
response = requests.post(url, json=data)

== Use Case: Setting up a Zap

You can set up Zapier to trigger a block to run by using the SeekWell API as a link:https://zapier.com/page/webhooks/[webhook].

=== Steps:

. Make a new Zap and create the App Event or schedule you want to trigger your SeekWell Block to run.
. Make an Action and choose "Webhooks" as your App and "Post" as your Action Event.
. Enter the SeekWell API URL along with the required data fields.
. Your block should then run whenever the Zap is triggered.
