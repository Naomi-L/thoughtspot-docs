== Google Drive

. Under "Destination" on the right, click "Add destination", and select "Excel".

. Select the spreadsheet from the drop down. We currently only support `.xlsx` files and this drop-down will show all `.xlsx` files in your Google Drive.

. Enter the Sheet name you want to send data to. #Please note, the entire sheet will be replaced#.

NOTE: If you need other data points or formulas on the same Sheet, send your SeekWell data to one sheet (e.g. "seekwell") and use a formula or pivot table to reference the data from another sheet.

. Run your SQL. When the query is done, refresh the file in Drive to see your data.
