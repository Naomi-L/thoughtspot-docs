. Select the spreadsheet from the drop-down. Since SeekWell currently only supports `.xlsx` files, this drop-down displays all `.xlsx` files in your Google Drive.

. Enter the Sheet name you want to query from.

. Run your SQL. Choose a destination to send the data from Excel to wherever you need it.
