With SeekWell you can query your Airtable bases (including across multiple bases) using plain SQL (link:https://www.sqlite.org/index.html[SQLite flavor,window=_blank]).

NOTE: To test this on an example Base, copy the link:https://www.airtable.com/templates/sales-crm/expvjTzYAZareV1pt[Sales CRM Base in the Airtable Templates,window=_blank].

== Connecting

. In link:https://app.seekwell.io/[Seekwell,window=_blank], go to Source â†’ "Add source" in the top right of the app.

. Add your Airtable API key to the source.

+
You can get your API key link:https://airtable.com/account[here,window=_blank] on your account page (Click on "Generate key" if you do not see an existing API key.
+

. Go to link:https://airtable.com/api[https://airtable.com/api] and click on the base you want to connect to. Check the URL for the Base / App ID, it should start with "app". The ID also appears in green on this page in third paragraph.

. Write a SQL query. Use the Base ID (`appkLTrRdxeM51z0P` in the example above) as the SQL schema name and the table name to test a `SELECT` statement.
+
[source,ruby]
----
select *
from appREPLACEWITHYOURID."Opportunities"
limit 10
----

NOTE:  Double quotes (`"`) are required for Tables with spaces in the name. For example, a table name of "This Has Spaces" will be `SELECT * FROM appId."This Has Spaces"`.

== Joining Tables

. SeekWell adds two special columns to your Table:

.. `_id` is the unique id for the record in your table. Use `_id` to join to "Linked" records / tables.

.. `_createdTime` is the timestamp for when the record was created.
+
You can use these like any other column.

. In the link:https://www.airtable.com/templates/sales-crm/expvjTzYAZareV1pt[Sales CRM Base,window=_blank], there is an `Accounts` table and a `Contacts` table. To join them, let's use the first `id` of the first linked `Contact` and get their `Name`.
+
[source,ruby]
----
select
a.__id as account_id,
a.__createdTime as account_created_on,
a.Size as size,
substr(a.Opportunities, 3, 17) as first_op,
substr(a.Contacts, 3, 17) as primary_contact,
c.Name as contact_name
from
appREPLACEWITHYOURID."Accounts" as a inner join
appREPLACEWITHYOURID.Contacts as c on substr(a.Contacts, 3, 17) = c.__id
limit 10
----

NOTE: This `substr` is necessary because Airtable returns linked records as an array. This substring returns only the `id` of the first item in the array.
