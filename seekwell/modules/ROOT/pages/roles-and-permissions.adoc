Team administrators can manage what functionality other users can access by hitting `command` / `ctrl` + `k`, and searching for "Roles". The following roles are available:

* Admin - Full access to the app including administrative features
* User - Full access to the app excluding administrative features
* Restricted - Allows administrator to select functionality / permissions individually.

To grant specific functionality to a restricted user, type the desired permissions into the "Permissions" field that appears when you select "Restricted" from the role drop-down menu:

** sql.view - ability to view SQL on `/run` in the app
** sql.run - ability to run SQL on `/run` in the app
** blocks.all - access *all* blocks
** blocks.tagged - access to only certain tags (see xref:tags-and-search.adoc[#Ô∏è‚É£ Tags and Search])
*** use the tag.[tagname] permissions to control which blocks the user can see

** blocks.view - ability to view blocks on `/` in the app (the "home" page)
