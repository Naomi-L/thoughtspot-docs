// Compose (SQL editor)

== Introduction

Snippets allow you to share small, reusable bits of SQL with your team.

== Demo

=== Creating your first Snippet

To create a snippet, hit `command` / `ctrl` + `k`, and search for "Create snippet".

Working with dates is a good example. Consider this snippet we use at SeekWell which creates three date formats from a `timestamp`.

[source,ruby]
----
date_trunc('day', {{column_name}})::date as "{{alias}}_day",
date_trunc('week', {{column_name}})::date as "{{alias}}_week",
date_trunc('month', {{column_name}})::date as "{{alias}}_month"
----

Once you type `{{`, you'll see the variable added to "Defaults". Here you can add a commonly used value for the variable (for example, `created_on`).

TIP: Variables are optional, not adding variables will create a "static snippet".

== Navigation

* To create a snippet, hit `command` / `ctrl` + `k`, and type "Create snippet".
* To use a snippet from a block, hit `command` / `ctrl` + `;` (semicolon).
* To view / edit / delete your snippets, hit `command` / `ctrl` + `k`, and type "View snippet".
