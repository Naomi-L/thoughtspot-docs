// Getting started

[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

To connect to *Snowflake* with *SeekWell*, you need the following fields:

* Account Name
* Region
* Warehouse
* Database
* Username
* Password
* Schema (optional)
* Role (optional)


To find these values in a Snowflake worksheet, first check the URL.

In the URL, you will find your Account Name (`abcd1234` in our example) and your Region (`us-east-1`). If you do not see a region, it means you're in the default region of `us-west-1`.

You can find your Database and Warehouse by clicking the *Databases* and *Warehouses* icons.

== Finding account details for JDBC


When using JDBC, you can use your existing connection string to find account details for Snowflake.


[source,ruby]
----
jdbc:snowflake://xy12345.eu-central-1.snowflakecomputing.com/?user=peter&warehouse=mywh&db=mydb&schema=public
----

In the example above:

* *Account Name* = xy12345
* *Region* = eu-central-1
** (if region is missing, it means your region is `us-west-1`)
* *Username* = peter
* *Warehouse* = mywh
* *Database* = mydb
* *Schema* = public
