:summary: The bubble chart displays three dimensions of data with each containing a set of values.

The bubble chart is a variation of the scatter chart, with the data points replaced with bubbles.
These bubbles add a third data dimension to your answer.

The size of each bubble depends on the measure you choose under *Edit chart* image:{{ site.baseurl }}/images/icon-gear-10px.png[].

Note that this chart type allows you to both *slice* and link:{{ site.baseurl }}/end-user/search/drag-and-drop.html#slice-with-color[slice with color].
The *slice* option only appears for bubble and link:{{ site.baseurl }}/end-user/search/about-scatter-charts.html[scatter charts].
It allows you to break up data based on a specific column in your data;
in this case, `store type`.
If you hover over a data point, you can see what store type it represents:

Your search needs at least one attribute and two measures to be represented as a bubble chart.
