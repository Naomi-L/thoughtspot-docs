= Scatter charts

last_updated: 8/12/2020 summary: "The scatter chart is useful for finding correlations or outliers in your data." sidebar: mydoc_sidebar permalink: /:collection/:path.html -- Scatter charts display your data as a collection of points, which can either be evenly or unevenly distributed.
Each point is plotted based on its own axes values.
This helps you determine if there is a relationship between your searched columns.

In this chart, there is a correlation between `total sales` and `total cost`:

Note that this chart type allows you to both *slice* and link:{{ site.baseurl }}/end-user/search/drag-and-drop.html#slice-with-color[slice with color].
The *slice* option only appears for scatter and link:{{ site.baseurl }}/end-user/search/about-bubble-charts.html[bubble charts].
It allows you to break up data based on a specific column in your data;
in this case, `department`.
If you hover over a data point, you can see what department it represents:

Your search needs at least one attribute and one measure to be represented as a scatter chart.
