:description: End-of-life information about CentOS-based ThoughtSpot software and hardware deployments.

This page provides the end-of-sale (EOS), end-of-service-life (EOSL), and end-of-renewal (EOR) information for CentOS ThoughtSpot deployments.

ThoughtSpot ships an xref:security-thoughtspot-lifecycle.adoc[embedded CentOS 7 Linux] with software and hardware deployments. Because https://endoflife.date/centos[RedHat plans to EOL CentOS^], ThoughtSpot will EOL our CentOS-based deployments.
