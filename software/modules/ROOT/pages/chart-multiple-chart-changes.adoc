:description: Apply multiple chart changes at once.


You can now make multiple chart changes and apply those changes when you are ready.  This significantly reduces the wait time by only reloading the chart after you apply all of your changes.

NOTE: This feature is in [.badge.badge-update-note]#Beta# and off by default. To enable it, contact {support-url}.


== Apply multiple chart changes

When there are multiple columns on the x- or y-axis or legend of a chart, you can reorder them by using the *Configure Chart* icon.

This example shows you how to reorder the y-axis columns.

. While viewing your Answer as a chart, select the *chart configuration* icon image:icon-gear-10px.png[chart configuration icon] near the upper right.
. Under *Y-axis*, drag and drop the column chips into your preferred order.

NOTE: If you either closes the config menu,or opens the setting's menu, or chart selection menu, the configuration of the chart would reset to default state.
