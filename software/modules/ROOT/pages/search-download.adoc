You can download your search as either a table or chart.  You have the option to download your table as a CSV (comma separated values), PDF, or XLSX (Excel) file.
When you download a chart, it will be a PNG file.  If you do not see all the search download options, your company may have removed them.
If you would like to download your search in one of the formats listed above, contact your ThoughtSpot administrator.


NOTE: If you are using the xref:answer-experience-new.adoc[new answer experience], your administrator set a standard footer for all answer and Liveboard downloads. If you have admin privileges, you can edit that footer for the whole cluster from the xref:admin-portal-search-spotiq-settings.adoc#visualization-footer[Admin Console]. If you do not have admin privileges, you cannot edit the standard footer for downloads.
