SAML assertion validity::
ThoughtSpot now supports 2 methods to increase the duration of validity for your xref:saml.adoc#saml-assertion[SAML assertion]: the `SessionNotOnOrAfter` attribute and the `maxAuthenticationAge` parameter. You can ask ThoughtSpot to disable either one of these checks. If you use both, and either check fails, ThoughtSpot does not authenticate the user. Some IDPs do not support use of `SessionNotOnOrAfter`. If your IDP does not support use of `SessionNotOnOrAfter`, remove that attribute from your IDP assertion and https://community.thoughtspot.com/customers/s/contactsupport[ask ThoughtSpot Support^] to enable `maxAuthenticationAge`.

This includes any hotfixes or customer patches on these branches.

If you are running a different version, you must do a multiple pass upgrade.
