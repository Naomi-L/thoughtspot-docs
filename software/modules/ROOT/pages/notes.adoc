=== For the Analyst

Updated Network ports:: We have updated the static ports used to communicate between services within a cluster. To see the updated list, refer to xref:ports.adoc#intracluster[Network ports].


// Naomi -- scal-157152

dbt Worksheet join rule:: Previously, when a Worksheet was created from a dbt model, the default worksheet join rule was "apply all joins". Now, "apply joins progressively" is the default. This means that when a Search is done on the Worksheet, joins are applied as each search term is added, rather than applying all joins to every Search.

// Naomi -- scal-149212

dbt sync:: In the past, ThoughtSpot generated a new Worksheet every time a user edited an existing dbt data model. Now, ThoughtSpot maintains a persistent connection with dbt and provides realtime updates. Users can update an object, update an object and create a new object, or simply create a new object.
For more information, see xref:dbt-integration.adoc[].

// Naomi -- scal-119947, scal-132902
dbt:: ThoughtSpot now supports dbt version 1.6.

//Mary -- scal-165262
Embedding in note tiles::
Embedding in note tiles is now available to all users and is on by default. You can now embed interactive content such as videos, pdfs, or Figma files into Liveboards using the note tile format. To try it out, enter a Liveboard, select the edit icon, and select *Add note* from the top bar. You can then click the embed icon and enter the URL or iFrame code for your content. You can interact with the content embedded in a Liveboard like you would with a website. For more information, see xref:liveboard-notes.adoc#embed[Embedding content with iFrames].

//Mary -- scal-163617
Personalized Liveboard Views::
Personalized Liveboard views allow you to save your own set of values for filters and parameters in a Liveboard without creating a copy of the Liveboard. When you change the values of the already present filters in a Liveboard, you can save the personalized view for future use. The personalized Liveboard view inherits any changes made to the master Liveboard, including changes made to pinned visualizations, tabs, filter chips, and re-ordering.
For more information, see xref:personalized-liveboard-views.adoc[Personalized Liveboard views].


[#business-user-9-8-0-sw]
=== For the Business User

// Naomi -- scal-161857, SCAL-160779
Verified Liveboards::
We made the following enhancements to verified Liveboards:

- When you request verification, you can now see the underlying data sources that will be shared with the verifier.
- The name of the Liveboard now appears in verification request emails.
- When editing an Answer on or pinning an Answer to a verified Liveboard, a warning banner appears indicating it may need to be verified again.

//Naomi -- scal-150635
Improved error messaging for Liveboard visualizations:: Previously, ThoughtSpot displayed generic error messages for connection errors on Liveboards. Now, you can see the error message received from the underlying Cloud data warehouse.


// Naomi -- scal-139411
Query performance visibility [.badge.badge-beta-relnotes]#Beta#:: You can now see the state of query execution for any Liveboard visualization while it loads. If a visualization takes longer than three seconds to load, ThoughtSpot displays the current query execution status (executing query, waiting for connection, or processing query) to help users identify the reason for the delay.

// Naomi -- scal-154258
Hidden columns in tables::
You can now hide a column from your table without removing it from your current Search. If you hide the column youâ€™re using to sort results, the sorting order is unchanged. To try it out, create an Answer, open the chart configuration menu gear icon, and drag the selected column to *Hidden Columns*. For more information, see xref:chart-table.adoc#hidden-column[Hide a column].

//Mary -- scal-172513
Change analysis: More insights::
When running change analysis, you can now see additional insights. For example, ThoughtSpot will detect values that underwent the highest percentage change between the two data points defined in your analysis, and values whose share of the total changed the most. The additional insights appear below the main analysis in the change analysis pop-up window.

This includes any hotfixes or customer patches on these branches.
