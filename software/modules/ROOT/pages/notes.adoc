[#analyst-9-0-0-sw]
=== For the Analyst

Upload custom geo maps [.badge.badge-beta-relnotes]#Beta#::

Upload your own custom maps and visualize data on xref:chart-geo.adoc[geo charts] with regions that are specific to you and your organization.
+
This feature is in beta and off by default. To enable it, contact {support-url}. For more information, see xref:geomaps-custom.adoc[].

Parameters::
Create Worksheet parameters to optimize your data inquiries. Use parameters to run different scenarios with adjustable values, without creating or modifying the constants in formulas for each new value. For more information, refer to xref:parameters-create.adoc[] and xref:parameters-use.adoc[].
+
This feature is in beta and off by default. To enable it, contact {support-url}.

Delete joins and RLS rules through TML::
When you edit and import TML files, ThoughtSpot now supports deletion of joins and RLS rules. Refer to xref:tml.adoc[].

Export FQNs when exporting TML files::

To reduce ambiguity when exporting TML files, export the fully qualified names (FQNs) for the objects' data sources. If you select this option, the TML file contains FQNs for the underlying tables and connections.
+
For more information, see xref:tml.adoc#fqn[ThoughtSpot Modeling Language].

Sharing connections:: Users with *can manage data* or *admin* privileges can now share Connections with other users or groups that have *can manage data* privileges. Once granted access to a connection, users can add, remove, and modify tables in that connection.

GroupAggregate Enhancements: Filters:: Starting with this release, you can specify column names within the ‘filters’ section of a group_aggregate formula, and any filter in your search bar referencing that column will be added to the formula.
+
For example: +
If you search for `fx` `color= ‘blue’` `ship mode != ‘car’`, where `fx` = `group_aggregate (sum(Revenue), {ship mode}, {color, quantity})`, then the formula will evaluate to `group_aggregate(sum(Revenue), {ship mode}, {color = ‘blue’})`.



[#business-user-9-0-0-sw]
=== For the Business User

Mandatory Liveboard filters [.badge.badge-beta-relnotes]#Beta#::

Mark certain filters in your Liveboard as mandatory. If you add mandatory filters to a Liveboard, the visualizations will only load after Liveboard viewers select values for the mandatory filters. Use mandatory filters for Liveboards that contain data that may not be relevant for everyone who must view and consume the Liveboard. Mandatory filters also lower query and performance costs.
+
This feature is in beta and off by default. To enable it, contact {support-url}. For more information, see xref:liveboard-filters-mandatory.adoc[].

Delete tables from ThoughtSpot:: Previously, when deleting tables from Connections, ThoughtSpot did not delete the table’s metadata completely. Starting in 9.0.0.sw, tables deleted through the ThoughtSpot UI disappear completely from your cluster.

Rename Liveboards and visualizations without entering edit mode::

Change the name or description of a Liveboard or visualization without entering *Edit* mode. The more image:icon-more-10px.png[more menu icon] menu for Liveboards and Liveboard visualizations now includes a *Rename* option, where you can edit the object name and description. For more information, see xref:liveboard-layout-edit.adoc#other-edits[Other Liveboard edits].

[#data-engineer-9-0-0-sw]
=== For the Data Engineer

+
--
* Add tags to multiple objects at a time

* Administrators can create new tags from the *Edit tags* modal

For more information, see xref:tags.adoc#data-workspace-apply[Apply a tag] and xref:tags.adoc#data-workspace-create[Create a tag].
