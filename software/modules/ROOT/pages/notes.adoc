[#upgrade-paths]
== Supported Upgrade Paths

If you are running one of the following versions, you can upgrade to the 9.0.0.sw release directly:

* 8.4.x to 9.0.0.sw
* 8.8.x to 9.0.0.sw

This includes any hotfixes or customer patches on these branches.

If you are running a different version, you must do a multiple pass upgrade.

First, upgrade to version 8.4.x or 8.8.x, and then to the 9.0.0.sw release.

NOTE: To successfully upgrade your ThoughtSpot cluster, all user profiles must include a valid email address. Without valid email addresses, the upgrade is blocked.
