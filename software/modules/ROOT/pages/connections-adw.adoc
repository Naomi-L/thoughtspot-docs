Connections to Oracle databases enable you to use your data directly in ThoughtSpot, and perform live queries to create answers and pinboards.

NOTE: Starting with the 7.2.1 release, the *Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse* (ADW) connection type has changed to *Oracle*. With this change you can now select one of two types of Oracle data warehouses: Cloud or On Premise. Existing Oracle ADW connections are considered Cloud.
