[#9-8-0-sw-verified]
[discrete]
=== Verified Liveboards

// Naomi -- scal-161857, SCAL-160779

We made the following enhancements to verified Liveboards:

- When you request verification, you can now see the underlying data sources that will be shared with the verifier.
- The name of the Liveboard now appears in verification request emails.
- When editing an Answer on or pinning an Answer to a verified Liveboard, a warning banner appears indicating it may need to be verified again.

[#9-8-0-sw-hidden]
[discrete]
=== Hidden columns in tables

// Naomi -- scal-154258


You can now hide a column from your table without removing it from your current Search. If you hide the column youâ€™re using to sort results, the sorting order is unchanged. To try it out, create an Answer, open the chart configuration menu gear icon, and drag the selected column to *Hidden Columns*. For more information, see xref:chart-table.adoc#hidden-column[Hide a column].

[#9-8-0-sw-error]
[discrete]
=== Improve error messaging for Liveboard visualizations

// Naomi -- scal-150635

Previously, ThoughtSpot displayed generic error messages for connection errors on Liveboards. Now, you can see the error message received from the underlying Cloud data warehouse.

You can now see the state of query execution for any Liveboard visualization while it loads. If a visualization takes longer than three seconds to load, ThoughtSpot displays the current query execution status (executing query, waiting for connection, or processing query) to help users identify the reason for the delay.

// Naomi -- scal-79850, scal-164909, scal-166159, scal-166160,scal-166161

We added support for the following connections:

[#9-8-0-sw-dbt]
[discrete]
=== dbt Worksheet join rule

// Naomi -- scal-157152

Previously, when a Worksheet was created from a dbt model, the default worksheet join rule was "apply all joins". Now, "apply joins progressively" is the default. This means that when a Search is done on the Worksheet, joins are applied as each search term is added, rather than applying all joins to every Search.

[#9-8-0-sw-incremental]
[discrete]
=== dbt sync

// Naomi -- scal-149212

In the past, ThoughtSpot generated a new Worksheet every time a user edited an existing dbt data model. Now, ThoughtSpot maintains a persistent connection with dbt and provides realtime updates. Users can update an object, update an object and create a new object, or simply create a new object.
For more information, see xref:dbt-integration.adoc[].
