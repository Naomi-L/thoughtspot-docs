We made the following enhancements to verified Liveboards:

- When you request verification, you can now see the underlying data sources that will be shared with the verifier.
- The name of the Liveboard now appears in verification request emails.
- When editing an Answer on or pinning an Answer to a verified Liveboard, a warning banner appears indicating it may need to be verified again.

You can now see the state of query execution for any Liveboard visualization while it loads. If a visualization takes longer than three seconds to load, ThoughtSpot displays the current query execution status (executing query, waiting for connection, or processing query) to help users identify the reason for the delay.
