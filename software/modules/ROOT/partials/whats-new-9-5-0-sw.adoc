=== Contextual change analysis

// Naomi-- waiting on Vikas

You can now identify the key change drivers for changes in your metrics in a KPI chart. Select the percent change label or select any two data points on the KPI sparkline to view change analysis on your top 5 columns by usage-based ranking (UBR) and identify the reason behind the observed change. You can view the changes in other columns by clicking *Manage attributes* and selecting the desired column(s).

=== Mandatory Liveboard filters

Mandatory Liveboard filters are now GA. Mark certain filters in your Liveboard as mandatory. If you add mandatory filters to a Liveboard, the visualizations will only load after Liveboard viewers select values for the mandatory filters. Use mandatory filters for Liveboards that contain data that may not be relevant for everyone who must view and consume the Liveboard. Mandatory filters also lower query and performance costs.

// Naomi

To enable business users to answer questions related to mix, contribution, share of, percentage, and total ratios, we added the keywords “of” and “percentage of”. These keywords help answer questions such as “What is the share of a certain store’s sales as a percentage of the regional whole?” Previously, searches such as these required the use of a group aggregate formula, which presented a barrier to users.

You can now use SpotIQ analysis to directly identify the key drivers for recent change in your KPIs. KPI change analysis allows you to drill down into the causes of change in your KPIs and customize the insights generated by SpotIQ.

To access this feature, go to your KPI chart and select the caret icon to the right of the percent change label. The Run change analysis pop-up allows you to customize the columns ThoughtSpot analyzes. Note that ThoughtSpot runs change analysis between the two most recent data points defined by the KPI’s time bucket (for example, daily or weekly).

=== Pivot table enhancements

// Naomi

We made the following enhancements to pivot table charts:

* When you download an xlsx version of a pivot table, the measure values are displayed as numbers instead of the general format.

* When you download an xlsx version of a pivot table, row and column labels are shown as separate cells rather than as a column-separated list.

* You can no longer add conditional formatting to a pivot table in heatmap mode.

* Naming of subtotals and grand totals are now consistent in the chart and chart configuration dropdown.

* We now support hyperlinks in pivot tables.

* You can now choose to show or hide row and column summaries and subtotals, from the chart configuration menu. When summaries and subtotals are enabled, you can choose to display them at the top or bottom of the pivot table.

=== Verified Liveboards

Admin-assigned verifiers can now mark Liveboards as verified. Users can now request these verifiers to review their Liveboards, and verify if the information displayed is trusted content.

=== Parameters

The Parameters feature is now GA. Any user can now create Parameters at the Answer level to optimize their data inquiries. Analysts can also create Worksheet Parameters that are available to all Worksheet users. Use Parameters to run different scenarios with adjustable values, without creating or modifying the constants in formulas for each new value. For example, easily adjust the attribute in an Answer to view your revenue by commit date or order date, as in the following image. To try it out, navigate to any Answer, search, or Worksheet, and select the *+* button next to the *Parameters* section in the left panel. For more information, see

// Naomi

You can now create custom groups, which can be used to classify values in a list you can then reuse across multiple analyses. As an example, you can use custom groups to search for which products are most popular, and define them by sales volume as “gold”, “silver”, or “bronze” level products. Custom groups are community objects which remain when you navigate away from the Search Data page and can be viewed by any user with view access to the underlying Worksheet.

For more information, see xref:custom-groups.adoc[Custom groups].



[#9-5-0-sw-date-picker]
[discrete]
=== Date picker enhancement in Search

// Naomi

We added support for rolling, fixed, and custom date filters when creating an Answer or filtering a Liveboard. Previously, when adding a date filter to a Search, ThoughtSpot supported the conditions `ON` (=), `ON OR AFTER` (>=), `BEFORE` (<), and `BETWEEN`. Now, you can additionally filter for `ON OR BEFORE` (\<=), `NOT BETWEEN`, `ON LAST`, and `ON NEXT`.

To try it out, click the filter icon next to the Date column in the left side menu, or click the date filter below the Answer or Liveboard title. For more information, see xref:date-filter.adoc[Date filters for Answers and Liveboards].

=== Group aggregate enhancements: filters [.badge.badge-beta]#Beta#
endif::[]

Group aggregate filter enhancements are GA and on by default. Previously, when using group_aggregate formulas, users could use query_filters to include filters entered in the search bar in the formula's value, but it was difficult to write a formula that accepted filters from only a single column.

Starting with this release, you can specify column names within the ‘filters’ section of a group_aggregate formula, and any filter in your search bar referencing that column will be added to the formula. Filters entered in the search bar that are not on columns specified in the third argument of the group_aggregate formula will be ignored. For details, see
