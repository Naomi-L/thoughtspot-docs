=== Mandatory Liveboard filters [.badge.badge-beta-whats-new]#Beta#
endif::[]

Mark certain filters in your Liveboard as mandatory. If you add mandatory filters to a Liveboard, the visualizations will only load after Liveboard viewers select values for the mandatory filters. Use mandatory filters for Liveboards that contain data that may not be relevant for everyone who must view and consume the Liveboard. Mandatory filters also lower query and performance costs. This feature must be enabled by your administrator.  For more information about mandatory filters, see

=== GroupAggregate Enhancements: Filters

// Naomi

Starting with this release, you can specify column names within the ‘filters’ section of a group_aggregate formula, and any filter in your search bar referencing that column will be added to the formula.

For example: +
If you search for `fx` `color= ‘blue’` `ship mode != ‘car’`, where `fx` = `group_aggregate (sum(Revenue), {ship mode}, {color, quantity})`, then the formula will evaluate to `group_aggregate(sum(Revenue), {ship mode}, {color = ‘blue’})`.
