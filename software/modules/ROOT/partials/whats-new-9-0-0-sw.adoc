Create Worksheet parameters to optimize your data inquiries. Use parameters to run different scenarios with adjustable values, without creating or modifying the constants in formulas for each new value. For example, forecast your revenue each week, depending on the product discount value, as in the following gif. To try it out, edit a Worksheet, and select the *+* button that appears when you hover over the *Parameters* section. For more information about parameters, see

=== Mandatory Liveboard filters [.badge.badge-beta-whats-new]#Beta#

Mark certain filters in your Liveboard as mandatory. If you add mandatory filters to a Liveboard, the visualizations will only load after Liveboard viewers select values for the mandatory filters. Use mandatory filters for Liveboards that contain data that may not be relevant for everyone who must view and consume the Liveboard. Mandatory filters also lower query and performance costs. To try the feature out, select *Mandatory filter* when adding a filter to a Liveboard. For more information about mandatory filters, see

// Naomi-- behind a flag

Previously, when using group_aggregate formulas, users could use query_filters to include filters entered in the search bar in the formula's value, but it was difficult to write a formula that accepted filters from only a single column.

Starting with this release, you can specify column names within the ‘filters’ section of a group_aggregate formula, and any filter in your search bar referencing that column will be added to the formula. Filters entered in the search bar that are not on columns specified in the third argument of the group_aggregate formula will be ignored. For details, see

=== dbt metadata tags for Worksheets [.badge.badge-beta]#Beta#

Manage your ThoughtSpot Worksheet column properties in dbt by using metadata tags to define column properties within your dbt model schema. Your dbt models contain all the necessary information, and you don't have to manually update the columns in ThoughtSpot when you make changes to your dbt model. To try it out, update the `schema.yml` files for your dbt models with the new metadata tags. For more information, see

=== Include FQNs when exporting TML files

To reduce ambiguity when exporting TML files, you can export the fully qualified names (FQNs) for the objects' data sources.
