When you download tables with date columns or view these tables in scheduled Liveboards, the format for those dates may differ from their appearance in ThoughtSpot, depending on the type of download.

In 8.4.0.sw and earlier, XLSX, CSV, and PDF files may look different from how the table looks in ThoughtSpot.

In 8.4.1.sw and later, XLSX files appear as they do in ThoughtSpot, but CSV and PDF files may look different. The following date bucketing types may look different for CSV and PDF downloads in 8.4.1.sw:
