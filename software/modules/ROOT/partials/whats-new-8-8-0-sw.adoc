=== Support for multiple contains, begins_with, and ends_with phrases in versus queries

ThoughtSpot now supports multiple `contains`, `begins_with`, and `ends_with` phrases in `vs` queries. For example, you can now have a versus query such as `state name begins_with 'a' state name begins_with 'c' vs state name begins_with 'd'`.

=== Choose sources limitation

You can no longer select more than 100 data sources to search on when searching data. This maximum of 100 sources improves performance and limits timeouts due to the selection of too many sources.
