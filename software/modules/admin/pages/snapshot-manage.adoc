== About manual snapshots

You must <<admin-portal-create,create a snapshot>> before making any changes to your cluster's environment, loading a large amount of data, or changing the structure of a table.
ThoughtSpot supports up to 20 manual snapshots.
You must clear them to create new snapshots.
You can delete a snapshot <<admin-portal-delete,from the Admin Console>>.

ThughtSpot generates a snapshot in approximately 20 seconds, depending on the size of the cluster.
To restore from a snapshot, contact link:{{ site.baseurl }}/admin/misc/contact.html#[ThoughtSpot Support].

NOTE: During an upgrade, all snapshots from the previous version of ThoughtSpot become manual snapshots.
