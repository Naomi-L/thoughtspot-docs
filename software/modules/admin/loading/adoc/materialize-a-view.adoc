:summary: Learn how to materialize a view to improve its performance.
:toc: false

To improve the performance of a view, you can materialize it.
This operation computes the data for the view and stores it in memory, just like a table.
You can expect a 3-6 times performance improvement on a materialized view over a view that is not materialized.
However, materialized views take up space in memory, so weigh the tradeoffs and benefits of materializing a view ahead of time.

All users will see the same data when using the materialized view as a data source." %}

To materialize a view:

{% include content/view-materialize/view-materialize-navigation.md %}

. If you don't have any joins, you may wish to add them now.
See link:{{ site.baseurl }}/admin/data-modeling/create-new-relationship.html[add joins].
. Under *Materialization*, click *Materialize*.

{% include note.html content="If you do not fill in the sharding details, the view is replicated on every node of your cluster.
Follow the links in this step to learn more about sharding." %}

. Click *Materialize*.
. In the *Schedule data updates* dialog, decide if you want to configure the schedule to refresh materialized view at this time.
+
If you want to skip this step and perhaps schedule it later, click *Setup later*.

. You can see the status of the materialization in progresses.

. Click *Update status* to refresh materialization status.
. Note that when the materialization completes, the status changes to *Materialized*.

+
If after some time, the status has not changed to *Materialized*, check the link:{{ site.baseurl }}/admin/loading/materialized-views.html#materialization-status[list of statuses] and corresponding actions to take.

When it says *Materialized* your materialized view is ready for search.
