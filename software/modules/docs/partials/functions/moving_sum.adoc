[#moving_sum]
moving_sum::
  Takes a measure, two integers to define the window to aggregate over, and one or more attributes. The window is (current - Num1...Current + Num2) with both end points being included in the window. For example, "`1,1`" will have a window size of 3. To define a window that begins before Current, specify a negative number for Num2. Returns the sum of the measure over the given window. The attributes are the ordering columns used to compute the moving sum.
