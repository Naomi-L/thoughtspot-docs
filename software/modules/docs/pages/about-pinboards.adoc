:last_updated: 11/23/2020


Create a new Pinboard to group and manage related search results. Pinboards are the ThoughtSpot term for a dashboard.

Pinboards act like live dashboards.
They are collections of your related charts, tables, and headline.

== What are Pinboards

You can pin charts and tables to any Pinboard which you created, and those that have been shared with you with the *Edit* privilege.
When you create a Pinboard, you can share it with other people with either the *View* or *Edit* privilege.
Pinboards are interactive, allowing you to perform actions like filtering, excluding values, and drill down on the visualizations.

== Create a Pinboard

To create a Pinboard:

. Select *Pinboards*, on the top navigation bar.
. Select *+ New Pinboard* on the Pinboards list page.
