We at ThoughtSpot design and develop interfaces with accessibility guidelines and principles in mind, as outlined in the https://www.section508.gov/manage/laws-and-policies[Section 508 Amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, window=_blank] and the https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG21/[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1, window=_blank], so that users with disabilities have a good experience with our products.

This report covers the degree of conformance to the WCAG 2.1 accessibility standard:
