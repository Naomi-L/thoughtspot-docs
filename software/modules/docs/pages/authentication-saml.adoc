= Authentication through SAML integration
:last_updated: 7/24/2020

ThoughtSpot integrates with SAML for authentication.

You can use ThoughtSpot's integration with SAML for user authentication. By default, xref:authentication-local.adoc[local authentication] is enabled. You can also configure a SAML integration with an external Identity Provider (IdP), allowing your ThoughtSpot users to log in using one of the supported Identity Providers.

Popular Identity Providers that ThoughtSpot supports include https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/build-sso-integration/saml2/overview/[Okta], https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/portals/configure/configure-saml2-settings-azure-ad[Azure Active Directory], https://docs.pingidentity.com/bundle/solution-guides/page/ozz1597769517562.html[PingFederate], https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/portals/configure/configure-saml2-settings[Microsoft AD FS], and https://developers.onelogin.com/quickstart/saml[Onelogin]. This is not an exhaustive list. To determine if ThoughtSpot supports your preferred IdP, talk to your ThoughtSpot contact. Refer to your Identity Providerâ€™s SAML documentation for specific information on setting up SAML with that IdP.
