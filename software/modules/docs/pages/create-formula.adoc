title: [Create a formula in a worksheet]

last_updated: 8/19/2020 summary: "You can define formulas and use them to create derived columns in worksheets.
" sidebar: mydoc_sidebar permalink: /:collection/:path.html -- You create formulas by combining standard functions and operators, column names, and constant values.

Anyone who can create a worksheet can add a formula to it.
Formulas are not reusable;
the formula you create is associated only with the worksheet it belongs to.
A complete list of available formulas and examples of each is available in the link:{{ site.baseurl }}/reference/formula-reference.html#[Formula function reference].

You can create a formula in a worksheet by using the Formula Builder.
When you do this, the result of the formula gets added to the worksheet as a column.
Use these steps to create a formula:

. link:{{ site.baseurl }}/admin/worksheets/about-worksheets.html[Create a new worksheet], or link:{{ site.baseurl }}/admin/worksheets/edit-worksheet.html[edit an existing one].
. Click the *+* button next to *Formulas*.

. You can see a list of formula operators with examples by clicking on *Formula Assistant.*

 ** ATTRIBUTE or MEASURE
 ** Aggregation type

. Name the formula by clicking on its title and typing the new name.
Click *Save*.

== Use aggregate formulas as Worksheet filters

Starting in ThoughtSpot release 6.2, you can use an aggregate formula as a Worksheet filter.
This is useful when, for example, you only want your results to show a measure when the related attribute is greater than some number, or vice versa.
You may only want to see `sales` when the `unique customer count` is greater than 1, or you may only want to see a `customer` if the associated `sales` is greater than 0.
Rather than add that formula to every search, you can create a filter at the Worksheet level.

To add an aggregated formula to a Worksheet, follow these steps:

. Create an link:{{ site.baseurl }}/complex-search/aggregation-formulas.html[aggregate formula] in a Worksheet, as shown in steps 1-6 above.
. link:{{ site.baseurl }}/admin/worksheets/create-ws-filter.html[Add the formula to Worksheet as a filter], and specify conditions in which it should apply.
