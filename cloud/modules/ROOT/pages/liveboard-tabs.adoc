. If the Liveboard already has at least one tab, the new tab appears, with no visualizations in it yet. If the Liveboard does not have any tabs yet, the new tab contains all the visualizations currently in the Liveboard.

. Name the tab.

. If you want to add more tabs, select *+ Add tab* again.

. Select *Save* in the top menu.

=== Renaming tabs
To rename a tab, follow these steps.

. Select the *Edit* button at the top right of the Liveboard.

. Double-click on the name of the tab you would like to rename. Alternatively, select the dropdown arrow next to the name of the tab, and select *Rename*.

. Type in the new name for the tab.

. Select *Save* in the top menu.

[#modify]
=== Modify tab visualizations

. Select the *Edit* button at the top right of the Liveboard.

. Select the *More* menu image:icon-more-10px.png[more menu icon] for the visualization you would like to delete or move to another tab.

. To delete the visualization, select *Delete*. This removes the visualization from that tab only.

. To move the visualization to another tab, select *Move to tab*. This option is not available if the Liveboard has only one tab. Select the tab to move the visualization to from the list, and select *Move*.

. Select *Save* in the top menu.

== Deleting tabs

When you delete a tab, ThoughtSpot deletes all the visualizations in the tab. However, if the Liveboard only has one tab, ThoughtSpot does not delete the visualizations. ThoughtSpot just deletes the tab itself.

To delete a tab, follow these steps:

. Select the *Edit* button at the top right of the Liveboard.

. Select the dropdown arrow next to the name of the tab you would like to delete.

. Select *Delete*. If the Liveboard only has one tab, select *Remove*.

. If the Liveboard has multiple tabs, a confirmation pop-up appears to warn you that this action deletes all the visualizations in the tab. If the Liveboard has one tab, no pop-up appears. ThoughtSpot deletes the tab, but not the visualizations.

. Select *Delete* again.

. Select *Save* in the top menu.
