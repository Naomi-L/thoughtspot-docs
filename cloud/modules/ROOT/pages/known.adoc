|SCAL-189185
|Scheduled CSV Email from a liveboard does not get updated.
a|*Symptoms*:

Total count of Answers and Liveboard under the *Admin* > *System activities* tab is displayed as 0 for the non-primary Org admin.

*Conditions*:

Liveboard has a rolling date filter applied and a CSV schedule is created on it. After days or weeks, when the rolling filter changes the data on Liveboard, the next job run generates a CSV with the last rolling in the filter, and does not update it.

9.10.0.cl release.

*Workaround*:

Try opening and saving the Liveboard once before the next scheduled run.
