Modify the connection parameters by editing the source mapping `yaml` file that was created when you added the connection.
For example, you can remap the existing table or column to a different table or column in an existing database connection.
ThoughtSpot recommends that you check the dependencies before and after you remap a table or column in a connection to ensure they display as intended.

To remap a ADW connection:

. Click *Data* in the top navigation bar.
. Click the *Connections* tab at the top of the page.
. Click the name of the connection you want to remap.
+
// [Select connection]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/adw-select-connection.png "select Connection")
. Click the More Info icon image:{{ site.baseurl }}/images/icon-ellipses.png[more options menu icon] and select *Remapping* on the upper-right-hand side of the page.

. Finally, click *Browse your files*, and upload your edited mapping file to update the mapping of your connection.

To remove a table from a connection, delete it from the connection details page.
