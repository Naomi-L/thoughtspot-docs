[#kpi-change-analysis]
== KPI change analysis
You can now use SpotIQ analysis to directly identify the key drivers for recent changes in your KPIs in ThoughtSpot Mobile. KPI change analysis allows you to drill down into the causes of change in your KPIs and customize the insights generated by SpotIQ.

To access this feature, go to your KPI chart and select the caret icon to the right of the percent change label. The *Run change analysis* pop-up allows you to customize the columns ThoughtSpot analyzes.

NOTE: ThoughtSpot runs change analysis between the two most recent data points defined by the KPIâ€™s time bucket (for example, `daily` or `weekly`).

[#localization]
== Internationalization and localization
You can now change your ThoughtSpot locale through the Mobile app. When your locale is updated, ThoughtSpot translates labels, date formats and number formats to match the default for your country and language.

[#mobile-push-notifications,Push Notifications]
== ThoughtSpot mobile push notifications
You can now receive ThoughtSpot mobile push notifications. Receive push notifications when a Liveboard or Answer is shared with you. Monitor scheduled and threshold alerts with push notifications.



[#deep-linking]
== Sharing with deep linking

You can share a link to objects in ThoughtSpot using instant messaging or email and the recipient can open the link in the mobile app or the web.
If a user has the mobile app, the link will open directly in the mobile app.
If they don't have the mobile app, they are presented with the option to download it or to view it on the web.
