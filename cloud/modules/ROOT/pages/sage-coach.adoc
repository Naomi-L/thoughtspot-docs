// designed specifically for data professionals and analysts

Sage Coach allows analysts to fine-tune the results of natural language search by examining and validating the feedback users give. Analysts can hand-select examples and pieces of feedback, personalize Sage output for specific users and groups of users, or for the cluster as a whole.

== Review user feedback

You can review user feedback from the Data workspace, and determine whether it should apply to only that user’s queries, or to the entire cluster. Use the query feedback modal to review feedback given to individual natural language queries, and use the query term feedback modal to review the translation of individual natural language terms to search tokens.

To give feedback on user queries, follow these steps:

. Navigate to the *Data* tab and select *Queries feedback* from the left menu.
+
A list of the natural language queries for which users gave feedback appears. Note that you see the following fields:

* the original natural language query.
* the user rating.
* the search tokens used to create the fixed answer.
* the level of access the feedback is valid for.
** Global feedback applies to the entire cluster, while user feedback applies only to the queries that user makes. Unless specified by an administrator or Worksheet editor, feedback applies only to the user level.
* the underlying Worksheet the query was generated from.
* the user who gave the feedback.
* the time stamp for when the query was generated.

. Administrators and Worksheet editors can make the following changes to the feedback on individual queries by selecting the box to the left of the original query, or by clicking the *more options* menu  image:icon-more-10px.png[ellipsis icon]
to the right of the time stamp:
+
--
* Delete feedback.
* Change the level of access– make user-level feedback global, or restrict global feedback to user-level.
* Fix the answer.

+
If you choose to fix the answer, the AI-answer appears in editable mode in a pop-up window. Click *Submit feedback* to finish.


To give feedback on specific terms used in natural language queries, follow these steps:

. Navigate to the *Data* tab and select *Query term feedback* from the left menu.
+
A list of all terms used in queries that users gave feedback for appears.

. Note that for each term, the following fields appear:

* Query term, or the string used in the natural language query
* Related tokens, or the phrasing used to generate the ThoughtSpot visualization for the Answer
* Original query
* Example status
* Worksheet
* Time stamp for last change

. Administrators and Worksheet editors can make the following changes to the feedback on individual query terms:
+
--
* Update query term
* Use as an example
* Delete

+
If you choose to update the query term, the term appears in editable mode in an AI-answer pop-up window. Click *Submit feedback* to finish.

== Permissions

Access to Sage Feedback depends on your access to the underlying data in the form of Worksheets, tables, and views. There are four types of access for any user or group:

. `TABLE_READ_PERMISSION`: A user or group explicitly shares read access to a Worksheet/table/view.
. `TABLE_MODIFY_PERMISSION`: A user or group explicitly shares write access to a Worksheet/table/view.
. `NO_ACCESS`: A user or group is denied access to the Worksheet/table/view.
. `AUTHOR`: Creator of the worksheet/table/view.

The following options describe the hierarchy of how access to Sage feedback entries are determined to be viewable by a user or group:

. Any user or group who has `AUTHOR` or `TABLE_MODIFY_PERMISSION` on a Worksheet/table/view can view or edit feedback from all users on that particular Worksheet/table/view within an Org. Note that except for System Worksheets, Worksheets are not part of multiple Orgs.

. Any user or group who has `NO_ACCESS` on a Worksheet/table/view is not permitted to see any feedback, even feedback they submitted for that Worksheet/table/view. This means if access to a Worksheet/table/view is revoked, the user or group is no longer able to see the feedback. The user or group is still able to view or edit feedback on any other Worksheet/table/view they have access to.

. Any user or group who has `TABLE_READ_PERMISSION` on a Worksheet/table/view can view or edit only their own feedback. The user or group is not able to see feedback from other users on that Worksheet/table/view.

. Administrators, specifically users with `ADMINISTRATION` privilege, can view or edit any feedback from any Worksheet/table/view within an Org.

All feedback is isolated to one Org.

Any user or group who can view a feedback entry can *Fix the answer*, *Change access*, or *Delete* the feedback entry.
