:description: Learn how to customize SpotIQ analysis.

Everywhere in ThoughtSpot where you can run *SpotIQ analyze*, you can configure a customized SpotIQ analysis.
The customized analysis can be a one-time customization or can apply to all future analysis of that particular data source.

== Finding customization controls

Every menu or location where you can run *SpotIQ analyze*, you can customize your analysis.
You access it using the lightbulb button image:icon-lightbulb.png[more options menu icon] or the ellipses menu image:icon-ellipses.png[SpotIQ analyze icon].

== SpotIQ window layout

Depending on where you run *SpotIQ analyze* in ThoughtSpot, the *SpotIQ* window has a different layout.

[#new-answer-experience]
=== SpotIQ from an Answer or search

. When you access it from an Answer or search, the SpotIQ window first asks you what kind of analysis you would like to do:
+
image::spotiq-analyze-choose.png[Choose analysis type]

 ** Outlier analysis: finds underlying anomalies or outliers in the Answer
 ** Trend analysis: finds interesting trends in the Answer's underlying data
 ** Cross-correlation analysis: determines how your metrics correlate with other measures
 ** Change analysis: if you select 2 or more data points, you can run a change analysis on those points.
Otherwise, ThoughtSpot does not allow you to click on this option.

. Next, SpotIQ recommends certain columns for analysis.
You can select all columns in the Answer, clear all columns, or search for more columns to include.
+
image::spotiq-analyze-select-columns.png[Select columns for analysis]

. You can also customize advanced parameters.
Select *Customize parameters*, on the *Select measures and attributes* page.
The following screen appears.
Scroll down to see more options, including customizations for specific analysis types.
+

+
You can customize the following parameters for any SpotIQ analysis _except_ a change analysis:

 ** General settings: exclude null values, restrict analysis to the current result set only, exclude zero values, or auto-tune date boundaries
 ** Insight count settings: choose the maximum number of measure and attribute columns to analyze

+
You can customize the following parameters for an outlier analysis:

 ** Outlier algorithm: choose the method of outlier detection (z-scores or median z-scores, Seasonal Hybrid ESD, or Linear Regression)
 ** Outlier parameters: choose the minimum rows required for analysis, multiplier for outlier detection, and maximum P-Value
 ** Insight count settings: choose the maximum outlier detection insights, maximum seasonality detection insights, and maximum linear regression insights

+
You can customize the following parameters for a trend analysis:

 ** Trend parameters: specify the minimum rows required for analysis, maximum P-Value, and minimum relative difference
 ** Insight count settings: specify the maximum trend insights

+
You can customize the following parameters for a cross-correlation analysis:

 ** Cross-correlation parameters: choose the minimum rows required for analysis, minimum correlation coefficient, maximum correlation coefficient, and maximum correlation lag
 ** Insight count settings: choose the maximum cross-correlation insights

+
You can customize the following parameters for a change analysis:

 ** Change analysis parameters: specify the maximum difference elements, the maximum fraction, minimum abs change ratio, and minimum change ratio

+
You can also reset these parameters to their system defaults.
Select *Reset to system default* in the bottom left corner of the SpotIQ modal.

. Select *Analyze*.

=== SpotIQ from a Liveboard

When you access it from a Liveboard, the SpotIQ window has two tabs:

* *Columns*, where you can explicitly indicate which columns to include in a SpotIQ analysis.
(You can select all, some, or none.)
* *Advanced*, where you can run custom analyses and incorporate R scripts into SpotIQ.

The *Advanced* tab has many options.
The panel scrolls, so more algorithms are available than appear in the following image

The *SpotIQ* insights page has an option to open this window to customize a single analysis.

The *Tell us more* window provides information on how to exclude a value from all future analysis.

== Eliminate null values

Null values should be eliminated from your analysis.+++<table>++++++<tr>++++++<th>+++From next analysis+++</th>+++
    +++<th>+++From future analyses+++</th>++++++</tr>+++
  +++<tr>++++++<td>+++// next
    +++<p>+++In the Search bar, add a filter +++<code>++++++<i>+++column+++</i>+++!= Null+++</code>+++ to the search bar. Or choose +++<b>+++Exclude null values from current analysis+++</b>+++, using the +++<b>+++Advanced+++</b>+++ panel.+++</p>++++++</td>+++
    +++<td>+++// future
    Set +++<b>+++Exclude null values from my analysis+++</b>+++ on your user +++<b>+++Profile+++</b>+++ to exclude them from any future  SpotIQ analyses you do.+++</td>++++++</tr>++++++</table>+++

== Exclude uninteresting column(s) in insight

You should always exclude columns you are not interested from your analysis.+++<table>++++++<tr>++++++<th>+++From next analysis+++</th>+++
    +++<th>+++From future analyses+++</th>++++++</tr>+++
  +++<tr>++++++<td>+++// next
    +++<p>+++Use the +++<b>+++EXCLUDE+++</b>+++ option of +++<b>+++SPOTIQ PREFERENCE+++</b>+++ under the +++<b>+++DATA+++</b>+++ tab to exclude any column permanently from all future analysis.+++</p>++++++</td>++++++</tr>++++++</table>+++

== Include an interesting column

You can always include columns that interest you in your analysis.+++<table>++++++<tr>++++++<th>+++From next analysis+++</th>+++
    +++<th>+++From future analyses+++</th>++++++</tr>+++
  +++<tr>++++++<td>+++// next
    +++<p>+++Choose +++<b>+++Customize analysis+++</b>+++ and select columns that you want to include.+++</p>++++++</td>+++
    +++<td>+++// future
    Ensure +++<b>+++Index Priority+++</b>+++ is between 8-10 on the column under the +++<b>+++DATA+++</b>+++ tab.+++</td>++++++</tr>++++++</table>+++

== Remove known date outliers

Your data may contain known outliers.
For example, you are in the middle of a quarter and only want to analyze the previous quarter.
Anything from the present quarter could contain an outlier.+++<table>++++++<tr>++++++<th>+++From next analysis+++</th>+++
    +++<th>+++From future analyses+++</th>++++++</tr>+++
  +++<tr>++++++<td>+++// next
    +++<p>+++In the Search bar, add a filter +++<code>++++++<i>+++date+++</i>+++< last time period+++</code>+++ to the search bar.+++</p>++++++</td>+++
    +++<td>+++// future
    Not applicable.+++</td>++++++</tr>++++++</table>+++

== Too few insights

Your SpotIQ analysis may not provide you as many insights as you think it should.+++<table style="border:1px;">++++++<tr>++++++<th>+++From next analysis+++</th>+++
    +++<th>+++From future analyses+++</th>++++++</tr>+++
  +++<tr>++++++<td>+++// next
    +++<p>+++Choose +++<b>+++Customize analysis+++</b>+++, select the +++<b>+++Advanced+++</b>+++ tab, and decrease the +++<b>+++Multiplier for Outlier Detection+++</b>+++ to a value closer to zero.+++</p>++++++</td>+++
    +++<td>+++// future
    Not applicable.+++</td>++++++</tr>++++++</table>+++

== Explaining Anomaly Insights

When SpotIQ finds insights with anomaly points, you have the option to run the Explain Insight command to have SpotIQ do further analysis on the anomaly points.

image::spotiq-explain-insight-1.png[]

To explain an insight, do the following:

. Click the ellipses icon image:icon-ellipses.png[more options menu icon] for the insight you want to explain and select *Explain insight*.
. In the SpotIQ window, click *Analyze*.
+
Analysis begins.

. Click *SpotIQ* in the top navigation bar.
. Click the *Analyses* tab.
. Find the name of the insight that you analyzed and click *View Results*.
+
The results of your insight analysis explaining your anomaly points appear.

NOTE: *Explain insight* does not work with Trend Analysis or Cross Correlation Analysis.
