:description: Before you start a new search, make sure you have chosen the right data sources.

When you first use xref:search-data.adoc[Search Data], ThoughtSpot intelligently selects a data source for you to search. ThoughtSpot chooses the most popular data source in the cluster which you have access to. If you would like to use a different data source, you can select it.

NOTE: As part of the new Data Literacy features, release 9.2.0.cl introduces a new and improved way to choose a data source. For details, see <<search-choose-data-source-data-literacy, Choosing a data source with Data Literacy>>.

== Choosing a data source

Select the *Choose sources* button to browse other data sources.

You will see a list of data sources that have been shared with you.
The data sources are usually created by your administrator. If you are a ThoughtSpot Free Trial user, you can xref:csv-load-free-trial.adoc[upload a CSV].

NOTE: You cannot select more than 100 data sources at a time. This maximum of 100 data sources improves performance and limits timeouts due to too many sources.

Searches happen in the context of the selected data sources.
ThoughtSpot will also make suggestions from other data sources for you, if what you're typing can't be found in the selected data source.
