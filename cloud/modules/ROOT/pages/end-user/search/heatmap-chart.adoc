:summary: Heatmap charts use color-coding to represent data values.

Heatmap charts are similar to link:{{ site.baseurl }}/end-user/search/about-treemap-charts.html[treemap charts]: they both use a similar system of color-coding to represent data values.
However, the heatmap chart does not use size to measure data, and instead requires an additional attribute.

The value of each cell depends on the measure you choose under *Edit chart configuration*.
