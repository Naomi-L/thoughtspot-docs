:description: Enable version control on your ThoughtSpot cluster, so users can enable version control on specific Liveboards and Answers.
:jira: SCAL-196890

With version control enabled, every time a user saves changes to a Liveboard or Answer, a new version is created and stored in Github. Any user with edit access to the Liveboard or Answer can browse the version history in ThoughtSpot and restore any saved versions whenever needed.

There are two steps to enabling version control in ThoughtSpot, which must be done in the following order:

. Enable version control for an Org.
. Enable version control for an individual Liveboard or Answer in the Org.

== Prerequisites

To enable version control for an Org, the following are required:

* Administrator access to the cluster/Org
* GitHub or GitHub Enterprise account
* Github repository configured with:

** One commit branch for _each Org_ where you are enabling version control
*** TML files for each Liveboard and Answer enabled for version control are stored here.
** One configuration branch
*** A set of configuration files required for the GIT integration and CI/CD to work.
** Personal access token (https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#personal-access-tokens-classic[Classic^] or https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#fine-grained-personal-access-tokens[fine-grained^])
*** Under _Select scopes_ be sure to only select the *repo* checkbox and then click *Generate token*.
+
TIP: ThoughtSpot recommends creating dedicated branches instead of using the Main branch.

* the https URL to your fork of the Github repository. Example: `https://github.com/xyz-user/abc-repo.git`

To enable version control on a Liveboard or Answer, the following is required:

* Admin or Developer privilege
* Edit permission on the Liveboard or Answer

== Enabling version control for an Org

To enable version control for an Org, do the following:

. Go to the *Admin* tab.
. Select the Org where you want to enable version control.
. Under _Application settings_, select *Version Control*.
. Under the message "Version control not configured", Click *Configure*.

.. For _Repository_ enter the Github repository to use for version control.
.. For _Username_ enter the Github username for the repository.
.. For _Token_ enter the personal access token for the repository.

If you don't a have personal access token yet, go to your Github repository and create one of the following access tokens, and enter it in the _Token_ field:

. Click *Continue*.
