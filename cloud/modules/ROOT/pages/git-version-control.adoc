Enable version control on your ThoughtSpot cluster, so users can enable version control on specific Liveboards and Answers. With version control enabled, every time a user saves changes to a Liveboard or Answer, a new version is created and stored in Github. users can browse the version history in ThoughtSpot and restore any saved versions whenever you need to.
