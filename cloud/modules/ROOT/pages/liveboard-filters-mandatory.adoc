You may want to mark certain filters in your Liveboard as mandatory. If you add mandatory filters to a Liveboard, the visualizations will only load after Liveboard viewers select values for the mandatory filters.

Mandatory filters are useful for Liveboards that contain data that may not be relevant for everyone who must view and consume the Liveboard. They also lower query costs, since the Liveboard does not automatically load all the data; it only loads the data after the viewer selects a filter value.

ThoughtSpot marks mandatory filters with an asterisk in the Liveboard filter bar:

If a Liveboard has a mandatory filter, Liveboard viewers see a prompt to select a value for the filter:

== Create mandatory filters

To create mandatory filters, follow these steps:

. Navigate to the Liveboard you would like to edit.
. Select the *Edit* button at the upper right of the Liveboard. If this button is grayed out, you do not have edit privileges for the Liveboard. To resolve this, contact your administrator or the creator of the Liveboard.

. In the top menu bar, select *Add filter*.
. In the *Add filters* side panel, you see a list of columns. Select the filter icon image:icon-filter-10px.png[Filter icon image] next to the column for which you would like to create a mandatory filter.
. Optionally specify values to include or exclude. If you would like Liveboard viewers to select the filter value themselves, do not select any values to include or exclude.
. Select *Mandatory filter* from the filters modal side menu.
