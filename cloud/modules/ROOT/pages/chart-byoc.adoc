:description: With custom charts, you can add your own custom charts to ThoughtSpot.
:jira: SCAL-179003, SCAL-202002, SCAL-214870 (gauge chart)

You can now use custom charts created outside of ThoughtSpot.

This article describes how you use a custom chart and how your ThoughtSpot administrator can add, edit, and delete custom charts.

Developers create custom charts in Javascript using charting libraries such as https://www.highcharts.com/[Highcharts^]. For more information, refer to https://github.com/thoughtspot/ts-chart-sdk/blob/main/README.md/[ThoughtSpot Charts SDK documentation^].

To enable the custom charts feature, you must contact {support-url}.

Once enabled, the xref:chart-gauge.adoc[Gauge] custom chart is available on your cluster.
