== Sync to Salesforce from an answer

To create a sync to Salesforce from an answer, follow these steps:

. Select the desired answer from the *Answers* tab or the ThoughtSpot homepage. You must have *Can manage sync* permissions and *view* access to an answer to create a sync.

. In the upper-right corner of the answer, select the *more options* menu icon image:icon-more-10px.png[More options menu icon]. From the drop-down menu, select *Sync to other apps*, then choose *Salesforce*.

NOTE: You cannot create a sync from an unsaved answer. If the *Sync to other apps* option appears grayed-out in the menu, first save the answer before trying again.

. If this is the first sync you have created for Salesforce, a pop-up authorization window appears. To give ThoughtSpot permission to send data to your Salesforce account, click *Sign in with Salesforce*, select your account, and click *Allow*.



. Within ThoughtSpot, fill in the following parameters:

* Edit the *Pipeline name* if needed. By default, this field populates with _PL-[Answer Name]_.
* If you have more than one Salesforce destination set up, then the *Destination* field appears and you will have to select a Salesforce destination from the drop-down available. However, if no destinations have been set up before or if you have only one Salesforce destination, the *Destination* field will not appear.
* Select *Object* from the drop-down menu.
* Select *Operation* from the drop-down menu. You can choose between *Insert* and *Upsert*.
