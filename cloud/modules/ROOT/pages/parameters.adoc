:description: Create Worksheet parameters to optimize your data inquiries. Use parameters to run multiple scenarios with adjustable values, without changing your answer.

A parameter is a container or a placeholder such as a number, date, or string that can replace a constant value or a list of values. Create Worksheet parameters to optimize your data inquiries. Use parameters to run different scenarios with adjustable values, without changing your Answers or Liveboards.

Parameters are useful for 'what-if' analysis, financial planning, cohort analysis, and so on. When you create parameters for your Worksheet, you guide users in their exploration of the data as they search on your Worksheet.

== Create parameters
There is no maximum number of parameters you can create for a single Worksheet. To create a parameter, follow these steps:

. Navigate to the Worksheet to which you would like to add a parameter.
. Select *Edit Worksheet* in the upper right corner.
. In the *Data* panel on the left of your screen, select the *+* button that appears when you hover over the *Parameters* section.
+

. The *Create parameter* dialog appears:
+
image::parameter-create.png[Create parameter dialog]
. In the *Parameter name* text box, enter a name for your parameter. This name should be unique for the Worksheet and easy for users to understand.
. Optionally, enter a description for the parameter in the *Add a description* text box. Use this field to add additional information users might need before using this parameter in their analysis. It is a best practice to use this field to specify the formulas this parameter is used in, in addition to any other information you add.
. Under *Data settings*, specify the data type the parameter must be: Integer, Double, String, Boolean, or Date. For more information about data types, refer to xref:data-types.adoc[].
. For integer, double, or date data types, specify the allowed values: *Any*, *List*, or *Range*. For the string data type, specify either *Any* or *List*.

Any::
Allows any value within the data type's constraints.
List:: Allows values only in the list you create. Enter a value in the *Enter value...* text box, and optionally enter what the value should display as in the *Display as...* text box. To add more values, select *+ Add row*. To delete values, select the *x* to the right of the row the value is in.
+

Range:: Allows values only within the range you specify. In the *Minimum value* and *Maximum value* text boxes, specify the values the range begins and ends with.
+

. For the boolean data type, optionally set custom names for `true` and `false`; for example, `0` and `1`.
. Set the default value for your parameter. In the default value text box, enter the value this parameter should default to. For the boolean data type, the *Default value* option is a dropdown.  `true` and `false` are the only options.
. Select *Save*.
. Save your Worksheet. Select *Save* in the upper right corner.

== Use parameters
Use parameters within formulas to run different scenarios when searching on your data or viewing Liveboards or Answers. For example, you may want to forecast your sales for the next month, based on various rates of growth. You might create a parameter, called `growth %`, with a range from 0 to 1 and a default value of .1. Then, you create a formula called `profit forecast`, defined by `profit * (1 + growth %)`. You can then create Answers and Liveboards that use this formula and change the parameter value to view your forecasted profit if your sales grow by 25%, 53%, and so on.

Parameters work like column names in formulas, but appear in green. For more information about formulas, see xref:formula-add.adoc[].

=== Change parameter values in an Answer

When you create or view an Answer that contains a formula with a Parameter, you'll know: ThoughtSpot displays the name of the parameter and its current value below the Answer description, in the row where it displays filters.

To change the parameter value, follow these steps:

. Navigate to the Answer you would like to change the parameter for.

. Select the parameter in the filter/parameter row.

. The parameter dialog appears. To view more information about the parameter, such as how to use it and what data type it supports, hover over the information icon next to the parameter name:
+
image::parameter-info.png[Parameter dialog with information button]

. Depending on the type of parameter, you may see a text box or a list of values. Above the text box, you may see a range of values you can use; for example, you may see "Enter a value between 0 and 10000."
+
If there is a text box, enter a value in the text box that is valid for the data type and is within the specified range, if there is one. If there is no range, enter any value that is valid for the data type. For example, if the data type is `integer`, you cannot enter a decimal such as `6.4`.
+
If there is a list of values, select the value you would like to use.

. If you would like to return the parameter to its default value, select *Reset to default* in the lower left corner of the dialog.

. After you enter a new value or reset the value to the default value, select *Apply*.

=== Change parameter values in a Liveboard

When you create or view a Liveboard that contains a formula with a parameter, you'll know: ThoughtSpot displays the name of the parameter and its current value below the Liveboard description, in the row where it displays filters.

If the parameter is set at its default value when you first create the Liveboard, it does not appear for users in view mode. To ensure that all users can see and use the parameter, follow these steps. You must have edit access for the Liveboard.

. Select the *Edit* button at the upper right of the Liveboard. If this button is grayed out, you do not have edit privileges for the Liveboard. To resolve this, contact your administrator or the creator of the Liveboard.

. In the top menu bar that appears, select *+ Add parameter*.

. The *Parameters* sidebar appears at the left edge of your screen. Double-click on any parameter you would like to add, or select the *edit* icon image:icon-edit-10px.png[edit icon image] that appears when you hover over the parameter name.

. The parameter dialog appears. To view more information about the parameter, such as how to use it and what data type it supports, hover over the information icon next to the parameter name:
+

. Depending on the type of parameter, you may see a text box or a list of values. Above the text box, you may see a range of values you can use; for example, you may see "Enter a value between 0 and 10000."
+
If there is a text box, enter a value in the text box that is valid for the data type and is within the specified range, if there is one. If there is no range, enter any value that is valid for the data type. For example, if the data type is `integer`, you cannot enter a decimal such as `6.4`.
+
If there is a list of values, select the value you would like to use.

. If you would like to return the parameter to its default value, select *Reset to default* in the lower left corner of the dialog.

. After you enter a new value or reset the value to the default value, select *Apply*.

. Select *Save* in the upper right corner of your screen.

To change the value of a parameter from view mode for a Liveboard, follow these steps:

. Navigate to the Liveboard you would like to change the parameter for.

. Select the parameter in the filter/parameter row.

. The parameter dialog appears. To view more information about the parameter, such as how to use it and what data type it supports, hover over the information icon next to the parameter name:

If there is a list of values, select the value you would like to use.

. If you would like to return the parameter to its default value, select *Reset to default* in the lower left corner of the dialog.

. After you enter a new value or reset the value to the default value, select *Apply*.
