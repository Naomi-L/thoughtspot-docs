:description: The life cycle of ThoughtSpot Cloud releases.

ThoughtSpot Cloud features go through the following stages:

== Beta

Beta features are incomplete, may have bugs, and are subject to change before they reach General Availability (GA). They are supported by ThoughtSpot and minimal documentation is available, which is also subject to change before GA.

****
Beta features are marked with [.badge.badge-update-note]#Beta# and are disabled by default. You must contact {support-url} to enable them.
****

[#early-access]
== Early Access

Early Access features are complete, and are available for customers to try before they reach GA, when they are enabled by default. They are supported by ThoughtSpot and documentation is available.

****
Early Access features are marked with [.badge.badge-early-access]#Early Access# and are disabled by default. You must contact your ThoughtSpot administrator to enable them.
****

For details on how to enable an Early Access feature, see xref:early-access.adoc[].

== General Availability

General Availability (GA) features have new or enhanced functionality that are enabled by default for all customers.

== Deprecated

Deprecated features still exist in the product, for backward compatibility, but we plan to remove them in a later release. Deprecated features do not receive ongoing support from ThoughtSpot. For details, see xref:deprecation.adoc[Deprecation and de-support announcements].

== De-supported

De-supported features no longer exist in the product. When you upgrade to a newer release, any workflows that rely on a de-supported feature no longer work. For details, see xref:deprecation.adoc[Deprecation and de-support announcements].
