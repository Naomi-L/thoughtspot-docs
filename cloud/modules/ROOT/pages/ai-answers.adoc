:description: You can now use natural language to search for answers to your business questions.

// persona: business user

Use natural language to search for answers to your business questions. You can begin a search from the Search bar in the Home page, or by entering your question in the Search bar that appears in the top navigation bar when you navigate to a different tab. Type your question in natural language, and ThoughtSpot translates your question into a SQL query using a Large Language Model (LLM). The AI-generated Answer appears, along with other related Answers created by your team.

== Give feedback

You can leave feedback on the accuracy of the AI-generated Answer by clicking the ‘like’ and ‘dislike’ buttons in the lower-right corner of the Answer. Giving feedback allows ThoughtSpot’s LLM to learn and increase the accuracy of its AI-generated Answers.

== Enable or disable AI-generated Answers on Worksheets

Worksheets with less than 200 columns will have AI-generated Answers enabled by default, while Worksheets with more than 200 columns will be disabled by default.

Users can decide to disable or enable AI-generated Answers based on the Worksheets to which they have edit access.

To disable AI-generated answers on a Worksheet, follow these steps:

. Navigate to the *Data* tab.

. From the list of data objects, select the name of your Worksheet by scrolling or by searching the name in the search bar.

. Select the *more options* menu in the top right corner of the page. Note that if the *Edit Worksheet* and *more options* menu icon are grayed out, you do not have edit access to the Worksheet.

. From the *more options* menu, click *Disable AI generated answer*.
