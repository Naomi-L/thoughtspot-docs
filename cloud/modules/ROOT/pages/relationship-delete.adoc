:description: You can delete a relationship between tables through the ThoughtSpot application.


You can delete a relationship or join between tables through the ThoughtSpot application.

You must have either the xref:groups-privileges.adoc[*Can administer ThoughtSpot* or the *Can manage data* privilege] to delete a relationship.
If you are not an administrator, you also need edit permissions on the table, view, or worksheet.

== Delete a relationship

To delete a relationship from the Web interface:

. Click *Data* on the top navigation bar.
. Find the origin table, worksheet or view of the join you want to delete through browsing, Search, or selecting the appropriate Tag(s).
. Click the name of the data source from which you want to remove the relationship.
. Click *Joins*.
You will see the list showing existing joins.
If you want to delete an external join from a worksheet, you must click *Joins within this worksheet* and choose *Joins from this worksheet*.

. Click the *Delete icon* to the right of the join name.
The *Confirm delete* window appears.

If the join has dependents, a different window appears, warning you that deleting this join makes the dependent objects stop working until you recreate the join later. However, ThoughtSpot does not delete the dependent objects. You can use this functionality to <<change-cardinality,reverse the join cardinality>> or otherwise edit a join without deleting its dependents.
. Click *Delete*.

[#change-cardinality]
== Reverse join cardinality
You can use the delete functionality to reverse or change the join cardinality for a join that has dependents. Delete the join, and create it again with the opposite cardinality. Deleting the join does *not* delete the dependent objects, but it does make them unusable until you create another join.

If a join does not have dependents, you can change the join cardinality by xref:relationship-create.adoc#join-edit[editing the join]. This allows you to change a many-to-one join to one-to-one. To reverse the join cardinality, you must delete the join and create it again with the opposite cardinality.
