:description:  Current schedule for ThoughtSpot Cloud cluster upgrades

ThoughtSpot Cloud releases are rolled out in a phased manner across the entire ThoughtSpot cloud environment. The initial Release Candidate is deployed internal ThoughtSpot, customer development (DEV), and customer Proof-of-Technology (PoT) environments. Once the quality of the Release Candidate is confirmed, it is rolled out as Generally Available (GA) across all production (PROD) environments.

This is the targeted release schedule for upcoming ThoughtSpot Cloud upgrades:
