You can now conversationally search ThoughtSpot using natural language, asking follow-up questions for further clarification or to take your analysis in a new direction. This conversational approach allows you to begin with a simple question, and ask successive questions to refine the answer you receive.
//ThoughtSpot translates each natural language question into a query, and answers in chart format.
