:description: You can refresh a view manually, so that its data matches the data in the underlying tables.

Materialized views can get out of sync with their underlying data.
If the status of a view is *Stale*, you must refresh the view manually to sync it with the table.

Note that until it is refreshed, the view remains searchable.

To refresh a view manually, follow these steps:

. To find your view, click *Data* in the top menu, and choose *Views*.
. Click *Joins*.
. In the *Materialization* panel, notice that the *Status* is _Stale_.
. Next to the _Stale_ status, click *Refresh Data*.
