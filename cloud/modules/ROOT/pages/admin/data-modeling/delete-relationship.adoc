You must have either the link:{{ site.baseurl }}/admin/users-groups/about-users-groups.html[*Can administrator ThoughtSpot* or the *Can manage data* privilege] to delete a relationship.
If you're not an administrator, you also need edit permissions on the table, view, or worksheet.

. Click *Data* on the top navigation bar.
. Find the origin table, worksheet or view of the join you want to delete through browsing, Search, or selecting the appropriate Tag(s).
. Click the name of the data source from which you want to remove the relationship.
. Click *Joins*.
You will see the list showing existing joins.
If you want to delete an external join from a worksheet, you must click *Joins within this worksheet* and choose *Joins from this worksheet*.
