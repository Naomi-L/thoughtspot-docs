// [Enter connection details]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/gbq-connectiondetails.png "Enter connection details")
 .. If you wish to provide the optional additional key-value pairs for your BigQuery connection, complete the procedure in step 5, and then click *Continue*.
If not, click *Continue*.
 .. At the Google account sign-in screen, select your Google account.
 .. Allow thoughtspot.com access to your Google account by clicking *Allow*, and then go to step 7 to select tables for your connection.

Using security passthrough may have implications for your Row Level Security.
See link:{{ site.baseurl }}/admin/data-security/about-row-security.html[About row level security (RLS)] for more information.

+
For service account authentication, do the following:

 ** Enter Project id, and Service account.

// [Enter connection details]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/gbq-connectiondetails.png "Enter connection details")

+
Refer to the link:{{ site.baseurl }}/data-integrate/embrace/embrace-gbq-reference.html#[BigQuery connection reference] for more information on each of the specific attributes you must enter for your connection.

. (Optional) Provide additional key-value pairs that you need to set up your connection to BigQuery, by doing the following:
 .. Click the *Advanced Config* menu to reveal the *Key* and *Value* fields.
 .. Enter your key and value information.
 .. To add more keys and values, click the plus sign (+), and enter them.

+
{% include note.html content="Any key-value pairs that you enter must be defined in your BigQuery data source.
Key-value pairs are case-sensitive." %}
. Click *Continue*.
. Select tables (on the left) and the columns from each table (on the right), and then click *Create connection*.

// [Select tables and columns for your connection]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/gbq-selecttables.png "Select tables and columns for your connection")
+
A message appears indicating the number of tables and columns that will be added to your connection.

. Click *Confirm*.
+
Once the connection is added, you can search your BiqQuery database right away by clicking *Search now*.
+

+
Your new connection appears on the *Data* > *Connections* page.
You can click the name of your connection to view the tables and columns in your connection.

The connection you just created is a link to the external data source.
If there are any joins in the selected tables of the external data source, those are imported into ThoughtSpot.

You can now perform a live query on the selected tables and columns of your connection.
Because the selected tables and columns in your connection are linked, it may take a while to initially render the search results.
This is because ThoughtSpot does not cache linked data.
With linked data, ThoughtSpot queries the external database directly, which is slower than querying data that is stored in ThoughtSpot's database.

You can modify a BigQuery connection in the following ways:
