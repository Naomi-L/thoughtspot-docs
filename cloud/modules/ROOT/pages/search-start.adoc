 .. Select your sources.
 .. Select *Done*.

You can also add multiple columns by clicking each column to select it, and then clicking *+ Add Columns*.

. Click *Enter* on your keyboard or select *Go* to the right of the search bar.
As you add items to or remove them from the search bar, press *Enter* or *Go* to ensure that ThoughtSpot updates your search.

ThoughtSpot gives your search an automatic title based on your search columns, and displays it as either a table or chart, depending on how it is best represented.
