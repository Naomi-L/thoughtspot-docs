You can now choose how null and missing date values appear in line, column, and bar charts in ThoughtSpot. From the *Chart configuration* menu image:icon-gear-10px.png[gear icon] for the date column, you can decide to show or hide null values in column, line, and bar charts. You can also decide how to display missing date values from the *Chart configuration* menu for each measure column.

== Show or hide null values

To choose to show or hide null values, follow these steps:

. Choose your measure and attribute values for your Answer. You must include a Date value to access the option on whether to display null values. Click the *Change visualization* icon image:icon-chart-type-10px.png[chart icon] to select the chart type as Line, Column, or Bar. You must include at least one attribute and one measure column.

. Click on the *Chart configuration* menu icon image:icon-gear-10px.png[gear icon] and select the *Date* measure column.

. Select the *Hide null values* checkbox to hide null values. Deselect this option to show null values.

== Choose how to display missing values for line charts

You can choose whether to display missing date values as zero values, line breaks, or an average of proximate values on a line chart. Rather than showing a sharp decline to zero every time there is null or missing data on your line chart, you can see the missing values represented as line breaks or averages of the closest values instead.

To choose how to display missing date values in line charts, follow these steps:

. Choose your measure and attribute values for your Answer. You must include a Date value to access the option on how to display missing values. Click the *Change visualization* icon image:icon-chart-type-10px.png[chart icon] to select the chart type as Line. You must include at least one attribute and one measure column.

. Click on the *Chart configuration* menu icon image:icon-gear-10px.png[gear icon] and select your attribute column (for example, `Sales`).

. Under *Line display format for missing dates*, select one of the following options:

* Ignore missing dates. Your chart will display missing dates as an average of the proximate values.
* Show gaps for missing dates. Your chart will remove sections of the line chart where there are no date values.
* Treat data for missing dates as 0. Your chart will display zero values for the missing dates.

. Choose your measure and attribute values for your Answer. You must include a Date value to access the option on how to display missing values. Click the *Change visualization* icon image:icon-chart-type-10px.png[chart icon] to select the chart type as Bar or Column. You must include at least one attribute and one measure column.
