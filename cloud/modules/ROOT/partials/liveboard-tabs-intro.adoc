You may want to separate your Liveboard into multiple tabs, grouping certain visualizations together in each tab. For example, you may have a *Sales* Liveboard with different visualizations for each region you sell in. You can create tabs for each region, such as *Sales -- East* and *Sales -- West*, and move the visualizations for each region to the relevant tab. To add tabs, select the *Edit* button at the top right of the Liveboard, and select *+ Add tab* in the top menu.
