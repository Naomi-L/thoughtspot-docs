=== Keywords "of" and "percentage of"

// Naomi -- SCAL-151987
// PM: Damian


The "of" and "percentage of" keywords are now on by default and available to all users. You can use the "of" and "percentage of" keywords to answer questions related to mix, contribution, share of, percentage, and total ratios. These keywords help answer questions such as "What is the share of a certain storeâ€™s sales as a percentage of the regional whole?" Previously, these kinds of questions required the use of a group aggregate formula, which presented a barrier to users. To try out this feature, enter a search phrase in the search bar containing the keyword, such as `sales percentage of store region`, and press *Go*.

// Naomi -- scal-177005. moved to 9.11
// PM: Manan

Rather than simply using conditional formatting comparing a column's measures to a single value (for example, `sales > 10000`), you can now use conditional formatting to compare a column's measures to another column or to a parameter. For example, if you search for `sales this year` versus `sales last year`, you can highlight where sales this year were less than last year. You can set multiple conditional formatting rules to a single table.
