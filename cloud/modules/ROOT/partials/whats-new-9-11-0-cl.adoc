=== Keywords "of" and "percentage of"

// Naomi -- SCAL-151987
// PM: Damian


The "of" and "percentage of" keywords are now on by default and available to all users. You can use the "of" and "percentage of" keywords to answer questions related to mix, contribution, share of, percentage, and total ratios. These keywords help answer questions such as "What is the share of a certain store’s sales as a percentage of the regional whole?" Previously, these kinds of questions required the use of a group aggregate formula, which presented a barrier to users. To try out this feature, enter a search phrase in the search bar containing the keyword, such as `sales percentage of store region`, and press *Go*.

// Naomi -- scal-177005. moved to 9.11
// PM: Manan

Rather than simply using conditional formatting comparing a column's measures to a single value (for example, `sales > 10000`), you can now use conditional formatting to compare a column's measures to another column or to a parameter. For example, if you search for `sales this year` versus `sales last year`, you can highlight where sales this year were less than last year. You can set multiple conditional formatting rules to a single table.

You can create custom sets, which can be used to classify values in a list you can then reuse across multiple analyses. As an example, you can use custom sets to search for which products are most popular, and define them by sales volume as “gold”, “silver”, or “bronze” level products. Custom sets are community objects which remain when you navigate away from the Search Data page and can be viewed by any user with view access to the underlying Worksheet.

NOTE: Query sets are BETA in 9.11.0.cl.

. From the *Data* panel, click *Add* and select either *Column set* or *Query set*.

NOTE: Query set remains BETA in 9.11.0.cl so no UI is available - see below steps to create a Query set using formulas.

A column set is a custom group of values from a single column.

. Select the column to create groups based on.
. Define the *Conditions* or *Bins*.
Note: If your selected column is based on numerical values, *Bins* will be selected instead of *Conditions*.
  . Optionally add additional conditions, or add additional groups.
  . Rank/order the conditions by drag & drop. If multiple conditions are true the highest ranked is the one that will be used.
  . Choose to return remaining values as *Individual values*, or as a *Group*.
. Define a *Set name* and a *Set description* for the set.
. Click *Create*.
The set is now available from the left menu for use in this and other answers.

A query set is a custom query

// Mary -- SCAL-150356
