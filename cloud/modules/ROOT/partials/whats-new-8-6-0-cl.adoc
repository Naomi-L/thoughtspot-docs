[#8-6-0-cl-content-discoverable]
*Discoverable answers and Liveboards*

// Naomi: keep mostly as-is from 8.5. change text to say "make this [answer | liveboard] discoverable" or similar

// GA in Free Trial and Team Edition

You can now make content easily available to your team members when you save or share an answer or Liveboard. Use the *Make this [answer | Liveboard] discoverable* checkbox that appears when you save or share an answer or Liveboard to grant _view_ access to your teammates. Any user who has access to the underlying data source (worksheet, table, view) and is part of the same user group as the author of the content, will be able to  discover and access the answer or Liveboard in *Search Answers*. +
Select this checkbox to publish your content in the list of relevant results when a teammate uses the *Search Answers* feature, or de-select to keep your content private.

[#8-6-0-cl-delete-relationship]
*Delete relationships that have dependents*

You can now delete a join from the ThoughtSpot UI even if the join has dependents. Previously, you had to delete any objects dependent on the join before you could delete the join itself. This change allows you to delete a join and create it again in the other direction, without invalidating or deleting any dependent objects. For more information,
