=== Okta authentication

In this release, ThoughtSpot switched to a new, industry-standard cloud authentication method through Okta. This switch involves several external improvements to authentication:

* Ability to map IDP attributes for SAML authentication from the ThoughtSpot Admin Console (username, email, and display name). For more information,

ifdef::pendo-links[]
see xref:authentication-integration.adoc[Managing authentication with SAML,window=_blank].
endif::[]
* Account activation monitoring from the Users section of the Admin Console: if a user still needs to activate their account, administrators can see that information in the Users section and re-send their activation email. For more information,
