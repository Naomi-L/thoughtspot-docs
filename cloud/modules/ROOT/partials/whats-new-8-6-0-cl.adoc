*Discoverable answers and Liveboards*

You can now make content easily available to your team members when you save or share an answer or Liveboard. Use the *Make this [answer | Liveboard] discoverable* checkbox that appears when you save or share an answer or Liveboard to grant _view_ access to your teammates. Any user who has access to the underlying data source (worksheet, table, view) and is part of the same user group as the author of the content, will be able to  discover and access the answer or Liveboard in *Search Answers*. +
Select this checkbox to publish your content in the list of relevant results when a teammate uses the *Search Answers* feature, or de-select to keep your content private.
