=== Spotter trial edition

// Mark. jira: SCAL-212696. docs jira: SCAL-?
// PM: Neerav

Spotter is a simple, self-service, chat-based interface for getting answers from your data. Spotter enables you to talk to your data in a whole new way.

With Spotter, it’s as simple as connecting a data source, coaching Spotter on the types of questions you want to ask, and then chatting with Spotter to get answers.

To sign up for the trial edition of Spotter, go to: <link-to-be-added>.

Introducing Spotter, our new unified, conversational search experience. When enabled, you can enter the Spotter interface from the search bar on the Home page, or by clicking *Spotter* on any visualization pinned to a Liveboard.

You can ask successive questions to hone in on business insights, open a preview of the underlying data, drill down, edit or undo changes to the resulting AI-generated Answers, see what terms Spotter changed from question to question, and submit feedback to train Spotter's interpretations. Analysts can also coach Spotter how to interpret certain terms from the Admin page. To enable this feature, contact your administrator.

We made the following changes to visualizations on Liveboards:

* You can now hover over items in a visualization's legend to highlight the data that corresponds to that column.
* You can hover over a truncated legend to see the full text label of the corresponding column in a tooltip.
* We increased the readability for the smallest size of Liveboard visualizations. Now, minimum-sized visualizations display only the chart, omitting the x- and y-axes and labels. You can hover over select data points to see the values.

Rather than using conditional formatting to highlight values in a chart in a single color, you can now set a gradient-based rule to show the range of values in a chart as shades in a continuous gradient. For example, you can add a rule to a Discount column and see the lowest values in shades of red while the highest values are in shades of blue. You can also set a midpoint, where the middle value is in white.
