ThoughtSpot supports querying external tables stored in external data stores, such as Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage. These external tables can be in formats such as text, parquet, avro, or json.

After you create the external tables in your {connection} environment, you can query them like any other table in your connection. You can also join them to other tables in the connection. External tables in ThoughtSpot behave in the same way that regular tables from your connection do. However, note that there may be performance implications when querying the external tables, since you do not store them in the cloud data warehouse.

This option is available for Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, and Snowflake.
