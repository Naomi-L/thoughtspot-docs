New Liveboard experience deprecations::
The following features are *_not_* available with the new Liveboard experience, but they are available in the classic experience.
The new Liveboard experience is off by default, but administrators can turn it on for their cluster.
If you would like your company to be able to use these de-supported features, you can turn the new Liveboard experience off for your company xref:liveboard-experience-new.adoc#global-enablement[from the Admin Console].
Alternatively, if it is available in your environment, you can turn it on or off individually from your profile.

* *Share a visualization:* The share button for a specific visualization within a Liveboard is no longer available. Instead, share the Liveboard. Then, select the *more* menu image:icon-more-10px.png[] for the visualization, and select *Copy link*. This provides you with a link to the specific visualization within the Liveboard. You can send that link to the user you shared the Liveboard with.
* *Switch between Liveboards from the Liveboard title:* This feature allowed you to click on a Liveboard title and view a list of other recently edited Liveboards that you could click on. Instead, navigate between Liveboards from your home page, or the Liveboard list page.
