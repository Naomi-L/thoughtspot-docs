You can now use SpotIQ analysis to directly investigate the main reasons for recent change in your KPIs from your Liveboards. To access this feature, enter the Liveboard containing your KPI and select the caret icon to the right of the percent change label. The *Run change analysis* pop-up allows you to select the columns ThoughtSpot analyzes. Note that ThoughtSpot runs analysis between the two most recent data points defined by the KPIâ€™s time bucket (for example, `daily` or `weekly`).
