=== ThoughtSpot Sync Salesforce connection

// Naomi

ThoughtSpot Sync for Salesforce is now GA and on by default. You can now sync data directly from an answer or custom SQL view to Salesforce. Using ThoughtSpot Sync, you can push insights directly to Salesforce, notify your teams, and view data in context. ThoughtSpot Sync automatically establishes a secure pipeline to the destination app and thus eliminates the need for building custom connectors.
