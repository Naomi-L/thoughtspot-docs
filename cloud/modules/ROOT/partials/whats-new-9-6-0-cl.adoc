// Naomi

When running change analysis, you can now see additional insights on attributes not included in your analysis. For example, ThoughtSpot might detect values that underwent the most significant percentage change between the two data points defined in your analysis, or identify values whose share of the total changed the most. If such changes are present in the data, the additional insights appear below the main analysis in the change analysis pop-up window.

// NOTE: Additional insights are only available for Sum and Count aggregates.

You can now embed content such as videos, pdfs, or figma files into Liveboards using the Note Tile format. To try it out, enter a Liveboard, select the edit icon, and select *Add note* from the top bar. You can then click the embed icon and enter the URL for the content you want to embed. You can interact with the content embedded in a Liveboard like you would with a website. This feature must be enabled by your administrator.

[#9-6-0-cl-alation]
[discrete]
=== Alation data catalog integration

// Naomi

You can now import metadata information related to your tables and columns from Alation into ThoughtSpot. From the *Data* tab, you can set up a connection to Alation to import column descriptions, column verification status, table descriptions, and table verification status. This information appears when you click on the corresponding table or column in *Search data*. Once connected, metadata information is visible to all users.

[#9-6-0-cl-rename]
[discrete]
=== Renaming column names

// Naomi

You can now rename columns in an Answer and see the new name reflected on the table header, tooltips, legend, and chart configuration menu. Changes made on an Answer are not reflected in the underlying Worksheet.


[#9-6-0-cl-sage]
[discrete]
=== Index Statistics Liveboard

// Naomi

Admin users can now see indexing statistics for their cluster using the Index Statistics Liveboard. You can filter the results by connection, table, and column, and see the breakdown of indexed tokens in the visualizations. This Liveboard helps you see how many tokens you are using, and can help you diagnose indexing issues and errors.

[#9-6-0-cl-dbt]
[discrete]
=== dbt sync

// Naomi

In the past, ThoughtSpot generated a new Worksheet every time a user edited an existing dbt data model. Now, when you add to a dbt Worksheet in ThoughtSpot and sync to dbt, the changes are reflected on the ThoughtSpot Worksheet and the underlying dbt object. Users can update existing objects, update an existing object and create a new object, or simply create a new object.

[#9-6-0-cl-dbt-hardening]
[discrete]
=== dbt Worksheet join rule

Previously, when a Worksheet was created, the default worksheet join rule was "apply all joins". Currently, "apply joins progressively" is the default. This means that when a Search is done on the Worksheet, joins are applied as each search term is added, rather than applying all joins to every Search.

* When you request verification, you can now see the underlying data sources that will be shared with the verifier.
* The name of the Liveboard now appears in verification request emails.
* A banner appears when you edit an Answer on, or pin an Answer to, a verified Liveboard, warning that making any modification will add a banner that advises the Liveboard has been modified and may need to be verified again.

You can now hide a column from your table or visualization without removing it from your current Search. If you hide the column you're using to sort results, the sorting order is unchanged. To try it out, create an Answer, open the chart configuration menu image:icon-gear-10px.png[gear icon], and drag the selected column to *Hidden Columns*.
