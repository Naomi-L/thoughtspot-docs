In this release, we completely redesigned the home page, where you can ask natural-language questions with Sage, and view your watchlist, favorites, library of Answers and Liveboards, and more. With the new left-hand navigation, you can go directly to your Liveboards, Answers, SpotIQ Analysis, and Monitor Subscriptions.

In this release, we introduce a completely redesigned navigation experience organized by persona. The new app switcher allows business users, analysts, data engineers, IT Ops, and developers to work in separate contextual sections designed specifically for their needs. In addition, each app has left-hand navigation to create better consistency and ease of use for users switching between the different apps.

=== Drill down in change analysis

// Naomi – SCAL-180942. doc: SCAL-?
// PM: Vikas

Drill down in change analysis is now on by default and available to all users. You can now drill down on specific columns in change analysis, in order to identify change drivers within your data. For example, if you run an analysis on sales monthly and find out that the 'jacket' item type changed the most, you can easily drill down on jacket sales and identify which region contributed the most to the change in sales.

You can create custom sets, which can be used to classify values in a list that you can then reuse across multiple analyses. ThoughtSpot introduces query sets in this release. A query set is a custom group of values from a collection of objects in your database.
Custom sets are community objects which remain when you navigate away from the *Search Data* page and can be used by any user with view access to the underlying Worksheet. To enable this feature, contact {support-url}.
