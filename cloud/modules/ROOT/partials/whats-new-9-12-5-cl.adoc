The new app switcher allows business users, analysts, data engineers, IT Ops, and developers to work in separate contextual sections designed specifically for their needs. In addition, each app has left-hand navigation to create better consistency and ease of use for users switching between the different apps.

=== Drill down in change analysis

// Naomi – SCAL-180942. doc: SCAL-205576 (approved)
// PM: Vikas

Drill down in change analysis is now on by default and available to all users. You can now drill down on specific columns in change analysis, in order to identify change drivers within your data. For example, if you run an analysis on sales monthly and find out that the 'jacket' item type changed the most, you can easily drill down on jacket sales and identify which region contributed the most to the change in sales.

We made the following changes to Sage Coach:

* Only users with edit access to a given Worksheet can edit feedback on that Worksheet. Only Worksheet editors can promote feedback on a Worksheet to global. While users are able to delete or edit their own feedback when it is at user-level, they cannot edit or delete their feedback when it is at global-level.
