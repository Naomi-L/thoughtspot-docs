=== Snowflake CSV upload
endif::[]
Snowflake CSV upload is GA in this release. Now you have a quick and easy way to complete one-time data loads of small files that are not present in your cloud data warehouse. You can now upload a CSV file to the database of your Snowflake connection that can be joined to other tables or Worksheets in your connection. Once your administrator enables this feature, go to *Data* > *Utilities*, and click *Upload CSV*.
