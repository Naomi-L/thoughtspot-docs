=== Group aggregatation enhancements: filters [.badge.badge-beta]#Beta#
endif::[]
// Naomi-- behind a flag

Previously, when using group_aggregate formulas, users could use query_filters to include filters entered in the search bar in the formula's value, but it was difficult to write a formula that accepted filters from only a single column. Starting with this release, you can specify column names within the ‘filters’ section of a group_aggregate formula, and any filter in your search bar referencing that column will be added to the formula. Filters entered in the search bar that are not on columns specified in the third argument of the group_aggregate formula will be ignored.

For example:
Say that you search for `group formula` `color= ‘blue’` `ship mode != ‘car’`, where `group formula = group_aggregate (sum(Revenue), {ship mode}, {color, quantity})`. In this case, the formula will adopt the color = blue filter but ignore the ship mode filter, evaluating to `group_aggregate(sum(Revenue), {ship mode}, {color = ‘blue’})`.

[#9-0-0-cl-chart-config-apply]
[discrete]
=== Apply button on Configure menu under Edit Chart
Every time when a user moves a field in the config menu, the chart reloads. When a user has multiple fields, they need to rearrange a lot of them to reach a desired chart, so every reload leads to a wait time of 2-5 seconds.

To reduce the reloads and wait time, we introduced Apply and Reset buttons on configure menu. This feature must be enabled by your administrator.
For more information, see
ifndef::pendo-links[]
xref:chart-x-axis.adoc[Reorder labels on the axis or legend].
