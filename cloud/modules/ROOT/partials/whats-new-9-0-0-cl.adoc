[#9-0-0-cl-mandatory-filters]
[discrete]
=== Mandatory filters

Mark certain filters in your Liveboard as mandatory. If you add mandatory filters to a Liveboard, the visualizations will only load after Liveboard viewers select values for the mandatory filters. Use mandatory filters for Liveboards that contain data that may not be relevant for everyone who must view and consume the Liveboard. Mandatory filters also lower query and performance costs. This feature must be enabled by your administrator.

[#9-0-0-cl-group-aggregate]
[discrete]
=== GroupAggregate Enhancements: Filters

// Naomi-- behind a flag and limited availability

Previously, when using group_aggregate formulas, users could choose to include all filters entered in the search bar by using query_filters, but it was difficult to specify which filters to ignore in the formula. Starting with this release, you can specify column names within the ‘filters’ section of a group_aggregate formula, and any filter in your search bar referencing that column will be added to the formula. Filters entered in the search bar that are not on columns specified in the group_aggregate filter will be ignored.

For example:
If you search for `fx` `color= ‘blue’` `ship mode != ‘car’`
Where fx = group_aggregate (sum(Revenue), {ship mode}, {color, quantity})
then the formula will evaluate to `group_aggregate(sum(Revenue), {ship mode}, {color = ‘blue’})`.
