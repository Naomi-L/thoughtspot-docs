[#9-10-0-cl-conditional]

=== Advanced conditional formatting

// Naomi -- scal-177005. add gif?

Rather than simply using conditional formatting comparing a column's measures to a single value (for example, `sales > 10000`), you can now use conditional formatting to compare a column's measures to another column or to a parameter. For column-based conditional formatting, you can set a rule to color a column's cells red if they are less than, greater than, less than or equal to, greater than or equal to, equal to, or not equal to, another column. For parameter-based conditional formatting, you can set a rule to color a column's cells red if they are less than, greater than, less than or equal to, greater than or equal to, equal to, or not equal to, a table parameter. You can set multiple conditional formatting rules to a single table.
