=== Advanced conditional formatting

// Naomi -- scal-177005. add gif?
// PM: Manan

Rather than simply using conditional formatting comparing a column's measures to a single value (for example, `sales > 10000`), you can now use conditional formatting to compare a column's measures to another column or to a parameter. For example, if you search for `sales this year` versus `sales last year`, you can highlight where sales this year were less than last year. You can set multiple conditional formatting rules to a single table.

You can now use Glean to search unstructured data, such as documents, PowerPoint, and Excel files, directly from a Liveboard. Add a Glean tile to your Liveboard to easily add context to your ThoughtSpot data insights. Glean inherits the filters and query terms defined by your Liveboard. You can configure Glean results to include or exclude these terms from your search. Glean results are tailored to each user based on their team, search activity, and preferences.

You can now choose how null and missing values appear in line, column, and bar charts in ThoughtSpot. Null and missing values appear as bars of 1 pixel width on bar and column charts. You can choose whether to display null date values as zero values, line breaks, or an average of proximate values on a line chart.

You can now drill down on specific columns in change analysis, in order to identify change drivers within your data. For example, if you run an analysis on sales monthly and find out that the 'jacket' item type changed the most, you can easily drill down on jacket sales and identify which region contributed the most to the change in sales.

Tooltips can also be customized to remove certain fields from the tooltips in a complex chart so that users are not overwhelmed with irrelevant information.
Configure the tooltip in *Chart configuration* > *Settings*. By default, fields visualized in charts are included in the tooltip. You can remove fields or add fields that are not visualized.

// Mary -- scal-143396, scal-163885. pare down a bit, add an image. What is the effect of adding a measure to a tooltip without adding it to a chart? What does it look like? Couldn't figure out how to add a field-- is that in scope for 9.10?
