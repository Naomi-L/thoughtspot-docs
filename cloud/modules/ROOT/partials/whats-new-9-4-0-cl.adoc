=== Indexing Queries Liveboard

// Naomi


We introduced a Liveboard to answer the following questions: +

* How many indexing queries are made?
* What queries are failing and why?
* How long are the indexing queries taking?
* Which connections have the most failures so that the admin can easily identify them?

Admin users can access the Indexing Queries Liveboard by searching the Liveboards tab, and use the results to improve indexing queries performance. For more information, see

You can now create reusable groups, which can be used to classify values in a list you can then reuse across multiple analyses. Reusable groups are community objects which, unlike formulas, remain when you navigate away from the Search Data page and can be viewed by any user with view access to the underlying Worksheet.

[#9-4-0-cl-contextual]

=== Contextual change analysis

// Naomi

// GA in 9.4.0.cl

Contextual change is now GA and on by default. You can now identify the key change drivers for changes in your metrics in a KPI chart. This feature is now available for administrators to enable, without contacting ThoughtSpot Support. Select the percent change label or select any two data points on the KPI sparkline to view change analysis on your top 5 columns by usage-based ranking (UBR) and identify the reason behind the observed change. You can view the changes in other columns by clicking *Manage attributes* and selecting the desired column(s). This feature must be enabled by your administrator.

endif::[]
* We now support visualizations comparing subdivisions of multiple countries in a single visualization. For example, if a selected column contains data from cities in the United States and Mexico, all data would be displayed on a single visualization.
* We now support multiple levels of subdivisions within a country, rather than just city and zip code.
* Zip code data is now visualized as an area within a region, rather than a point on a map.

// Naomi

We added support for rolling, fixed, and custom date filters when creating an Answer or filtering a Liveboard. Previously, when adding a date filter to a Search, ThoughtSpot supported the conditions `ON (=)`, `ON OR AFTER (>=)`, `BEFORE (<)`, and `BETWEEN`. Now, you can additionally filter for `ON OR BEFORE (\<=)`, `NOT BETWEEN`, `ON LAST`, and `ON NEXT`. To try it out, click the filter icon next to the Date column in the left side menu, or click the date filter below the Answer or Liveboard title. This feature must be enabled by your administrator.

=== ThoughtSpot for Connected Sheets plugin

// Mark

ThoughtSpot Connected Sheets is an add-on that allows you to connect to a ThoughtSpot instance, pull data directly into a Google Sheet from trusted data sources connected to that instance (like Snowflake, Google BigQuery(TM), DataBricks, and others), and use the tools in Google Sheets(TM) for ad-hoc analysis.

[#9-4-0-cl-data-fluency]
[discrete]
=== Admin controls for new data panel experience

// Mark

ThoughtSpot admins now have more control for enabling the new data panel experience for users. As before, an admin can enable *Data Fluency* by going to *Admin* > *Early Access features*. Each user can selectively enable the new data panel experience by going to their user profile, and setting the *Answer data experience* to *New experience*. In this release, admins can now make the new answer data panel experience default for all users of a cluster, by going to *Admin* > *Search & SpotIQ* and setting the *Make new answer data panel experience default* to *Enabled*.
