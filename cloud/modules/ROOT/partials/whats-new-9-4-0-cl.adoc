[#9-4-0-cl-contextual]

=== Contextual Change Analysis

// Naomi

// GA in 9.4.0.cl

Contextual change is now GA and on by default. You can now identify the key change drivers for changes in your metrics in a KPI chart. This feature is now available for administrators to enable, without contacting ThoughtSpot Support. Select the percent change label or select any two data points on the KPI sparkline to view change analysis on your top 5 columns by usage-based ranking (UBR) and identify the reason behind the observed change. You can view the changes in other columns by clicking *Manage attributes* and selecting the desired column(s). This feature must be enabled by your administrator.

endif::[]
* We now support visualizations comparing subdivisions of multiple countries in a single visualization. For example, if a selected column contains data from cities in the United States and Mexico, all data would be displayed on a single visualization.
* We now support multiple levels of subdivisions within a country, rather than just city and zip code.
* Zip code data is now visualized as an area within a region, rather than a point on a map.

=== Date picker enhancement in Search [.badge.badge-early-access-whats-new]#Early Access#

// Naomi

We added support for rolling, fixed, and custom date filters when creating an Answer or filtering a Liveboard. Previously, when adding a date filter to a Search, ThoughtSpot supported the conditions `ON (=)`, `ON OR AFTER (>=)`, `BEFORE (<)`, and `BETWEEN`. Now, you can additionally filter for `ON OR BEFORE (\<=)`, `NOT BETWEEN`, `ON LAST`, and `ON NEXT`. To try it out, click the filter icon next to the Date column in the left side menu, or click the date filter below the Answer or Liveboard title. This feature must be enabled by your administrator.

ThoughtSpot will deprecate the pin Headline to Liveboard feature. Beginning in the 9.4.0.cl Cloud release, users will no longer see the pin icon when they select table summaries.
