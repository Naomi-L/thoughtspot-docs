== Geo chart customizations

Geo charts allow you to customize the *Map type*. This setting affects the display of the parts of the geo chart map that do not contain data. For example, if your query is `sales store state`, and your company does not have data for Montana, but does have data for California, the *Map type* setting affects the display for Montana, but not California.

To customize the *Map type*, follow these steps:

. Navigate to any geo chart that you have *edit* privileges for.

. Select the *edit chart* icon image:icon-gear-10px.png[chart configuration icon] on the left side of your screen.

. Select *Settings* in the *Edit chart* panel.

. Click on the *Map type* dropdown, and select one of the options: Light, Dark, Outdoors, Streets, Satellite, or Satellite Streets. The default is *Light*.

For example, view the *Outdoors* and *Dark* map types:
