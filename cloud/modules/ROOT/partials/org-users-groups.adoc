On a multi-tenant instance, the cluster and Org administrators can create and administer users and groups. The cluster administrator can perform CRUD operations on user and group objects of all Orgs, whereas the Org administrator can create and administer users and groups only in the Org context to which they belong.

NOTE: To manage Org groups, the cluster administrator must switch to the appropriate Org. This includes management of the groups a specific user belongs to. To manage Org users, the cluster administrator can be in the primary Org or the specific Org the user belongs to.
