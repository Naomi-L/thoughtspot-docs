The multi-tenancy feature allows a ThoughtSpot cloud instance to be logically partitioned into multiple tenant-specific environments called *Orgs*. With Orgs, each tenantâ€™s data is isolated and protected with access control, and is invisible to the other tenants that share the same ThoughtSpot application instance.

If the Orgs feature is enabled on your instance, your cluster administrator can create an Org for each tenant account, configure groups and users, and control access to data objects. Each Org serves as an independent container with its own set of users and data, and provides the same user experience as that of a regular ThoughtSpot instance.

After ThoughtSpot enables the Orgs feature, your environment remains a single-tenant environment until you create an Org. To return to a single-tenant environment with the Orgs feature enabled, create users, objects, and necessary customizations in the Primary Org, and delete all Orgs in your environment. The Primary Org cannot be deleted.
