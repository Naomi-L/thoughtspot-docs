[#9-3-0-cl-cross-filters]
[discrete]
=== Liveboard cross filters

Liveboard cross filters are now GA. Click any data point in your Liveboard and easily filter the entire Liveboard by that value. For example, if you select *California* in a geo chart on your Liveboard, and then select *Filter*, all the other visualizations only show data from California. A visualization for *Total sales by city*, for example, would only show sales for cities in California. This feature is also called _brushing and linking_. To try it out, select any data point(s) in a Liveboard visualization, and select *Filter* from the menu that appears. For more information, see
