// NOTE: as of 4/19, we are not changing the way private preview features behave (eg we are not making them early access yet) until 9.6. So they are not in this what's new right now. This may change; if so, make sure to add them back in

[#9-3-0-cl-cross-filters]
[discrete]
=== Liveboard cross filters

Liveboard cross filters are now GA. Click any data point in your Liveboard and easily filter the entire Liveboard by that value. For example, if you select *California* in a geo chart on your Liveboard, and then select *Filter*, all the other visualizations only show data from California. A visualization for *Total sales by city*, for example, would only show sales for cities in California. This feature is also called _brushing and linking_. To try it out, select any data point(s) in a Liveboard visualization, and select *Filter* from the menu that appears. For more information, see

=== Access the contextual menu on left-click

Accessing the contextual menu for visualization data points with a left-click is now GA. Instead of right-clicking on a data point to include or exclude it, drill down on it, or show underlying data, now you can access the menu more easily, with a single left-click.

[#9-3-0-cl-note-tiles]
[discrete]
=== Liveboard note tiles

The Liveboard note tiles feature is now GA. Add notes to your Liveboards, so that viewers of your Liveboards can quickly understand how to use the data and visualizations you gathered. Note tiles can provide an overview of a Liveboard or visualization, company branding through images, definitions of terms used in the Liveboard, and so on. To try it out, edit a Liveboard, and select *Add note*. For more information, see

=== Contextual change analysis

// Naomi

// default analysis of change drivers in KPIs, appears as a pop-up with multiple tabs for each column change (top 5 columns) instead of taking you to SpotIQ tab, can use "manage attributes" to access changes in columns that were not included in default analysis. click the percent change label or select any data points from the KPI sparkline to see the columns selected by UBR.

You can now identify the key change drivers for changes in your metrics in a KPI chart. Select the percent change label or select any two data points on the KPI sparkline to view change analysis on your top 5 columns by usage-based ranking (UBR) and identify the reason behind the observed change. You can view the changes in other columns by clicking *Manage attributes* and selecting the desired column(s). This feature must be enabled by your administrator.

[#9-3-0-cl-filter-answer]

=== Change the filter order for Answer filters

Arrange Answer filters in the filter bar so that they are in a logical, coherent order, by dragging and dropping them to different spots in the list. This makes it easier for viewers of the Answer to understand and use the filters on the Answer. To try it out, open any Answer, and drag and drop the filters in the filter bar.

=== Liveboard header visible when you scroll down

When you scroll down in a Liveboard, the Liveboard name, menu options, and filter and tab bars remain visible. You don't need to scroll back up to the top to edit the Liveboard or check if you're filtering by a specific store. You can see the filters or parameters applied to the Liveboard, select the *Edit* button or more options image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] menu, and view which tab you're on from any spot in the Liveboard. To try it out, open any Liveboard, and scroll down.

=== Group aggregate enhancements: reaggregation

// Naomi

To reduce confusion when using aggregate formulas, the level of detail defined in group formulas is now respected at query level. For example, when trying to calculate the contribution of each store’s sales to the entire region, you might use a group_sum formula, where the sales at store level is divided by the sales at regional level. Your search would include the following columns: `Revenue`, `Customer nation`, `Regional Revenue formula`, and `Customer region`, where `Regional Revenue formula =  group_sum(Revenue, Customer Region)`.

According to the old reaggregation behavior, if a customer removed `Customer region` from the search bar, the level of detail in the formula would no longer be respected and the formula’s denominator would re-aggregate up to the total. In this case, the formula result would display revenue as a percentage of total revenue, rather than as a percentage of regional revenue.

Under the new aggregation behavior, the formula result will continue to display revenue as a percentage of each region, even if you remove `Customer region` from the search bar. Visualizations will also display the correct aggregation even if the grouping column is not added to the X-axis.
