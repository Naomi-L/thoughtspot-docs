=== Mandatory Liveboard filters

Mandatory Liveboard filters are now GA. Mark certain filters in your Liveboard as mandatory. If you add mandatory filters to a Liveboard, the visualizations will only load after Liveboard viewers select values for the mandatory filters. Use mandatory filters for Liveboards that contain data that may not be relevant for everyone who must view and consume the Liveboard. Mandatory filters also lower query and performance costs. To try the feature out, select *Mandatory filter* when adding a filter to a Liveboard. For more information about mandatory filters, see

KPI change analysis is now GA. You can now use change analysis to directly identify the key drivers for change in your KPIs.

To access this feature, go to your KPI chart and select the caret icon to the right of the percent change label. The *Run change analysis* pop-up allows you to customize the attribute columns ThoughtSpot analyzes to identify the drivers of change.

Group aggregate filter enhancements are GA. Previously, when using group_aggregate formulas, users could use query_filters to include filters entered in the search bar in the formula's value, but it was difficult to write a formula that accepted filters from only a single column.

Starting with this release, you can specify column names within the ‘filters’ section of a group_aggregate formula, and any filter in your search bar referencing that column will be added to the formula. Filters entered in the search bar that are not on columns specified in the third argument of the group_aggregate formula will be ignored. For details, see

=== Automatic synonyms for Worksheet columns

When you create a Worksheet, ThoughtSpot automatically creates synonyms for each column name. Users can easily start searching on your data, without knowing the exact names for every column. For example, if you have a column named `Product type`, ThoughtSpot might create a synonym such as `Product Category`. When a user searches for revenue by product category, for example, ThoughtSpot returns sales by product type. To try it out, create and save a new Worksheet. Your column name synonyms appear in the *Synonyms* column on the Worksheet details page.

=== Scheduled or downloaded Liveboard PDF width

By default, scheduled and downloaded Liveboard PDFs now render at a width of 1920 pixels. This ensures that most Liveboard PDFs you download or schedule look the same as the Liveboards you see in ThoughtSpot. You can also change this default width to a different width for your company, by contacting {support-url}. To try the new default width out, download a PDF of a Liveboard. For more information, see

=== Object Usage Liveboard

// Naomi

Use the Object Usage Liveboard to easily track how specific objects (Liveboards, Answers, Worksheets, or tables) are trending over time. Our new visualizations allow you to understand adoption on the object level, and filter on a specific user or users to see usage on the user level.

TML for Monitor alerts is now GA. Export, edit, and import KPI Monitor alerts programmatically, using ThoughtSpot Modeling Language. To try it out, export a Liveboard that contains Monitor alerts and its associated objects. For more information, see

[#9-2-0-cl-join-tml]
[discrete]
=== Edit join conditions using TML

Use TML to directly edit a join condition by editing the TML file's *on* parameter. This simplifies the previous process of deleting and recreating the join in TML or the ThoughtSpot application. To try it out, edit a TML file, and update a join's *on* parameter. For more information, see

[#9-2-0-cl-delete-tml]
[discrete]
=== Delete table columns using TML

Remove columns from tables in ThoughtSpot by deleting them in the tables' TML files. To try it out, edit a table TML file, and delete a column's name and properties. We support deleting a column from a TML file and removing that column's dependencies in the same zip file import. Note that if the deletion of a column fails, the whole import will fail.

// Naomi. Maybe not in the what's new? old join pop-up from views will now be the "new" join UI-- redirect to a join creation page

We standardized the method of creating joins for all data objects in ThoughtSpot. When creating a join from a view, users are now directed to a *Create join* page where they can choose a connection, name the join, and map the source and destination columns.

// ask pm if we want this in the what's new or the release notes. if it simplifies creation, we might want it

[#9-2-0-cl-search-suggestions]
[discrete]
=== Search suggestions on columns with many values

For any column with a high cardinality, which is defined as more than 100,000 unique column values, ThoughtSpot does not index the column if the index type is `DEFAULT`. This means the column values do not show up in search suggestions. Previously, this limit was 1 million unique column values. This change improves performance, and reduces index times and memory usage.

If you have existing columns with a cardinality between 100,000 and 1 million, and you use these columns' search suggestions regularly, ThoughtSpot will continue to index these columns.
