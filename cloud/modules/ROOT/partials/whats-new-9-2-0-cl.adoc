[#9-2-0-cl-search-suggestions]
[discrete]
=== Search suggestions on columns with many values

For any column with a high cardinality, which is defined as more than 100,000 unique column values, ThoughtSpot does not index the column if the index type is `DEFAULT`. This means the column values do not show up in search suggestions. Previously, this limit was 1 million unique column values. This change improves performance, and reduces index times and memory usage.

If you have existing columns with a cardinality between 100,000 and 1 million, and you use these columns' search suggestions regularly, ThoughtSpot will continue to index these columns.
