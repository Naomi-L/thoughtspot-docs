You can now sync data directly from an answer or custom SQL view to Salesforce. Using ThoughtSpot Sync, you can push insights directly to Salesforce, notify your teams, and view data in context. ThoughtSpot Sync automatically establishes a secure pipeline to the destination app and thus eliminates the need for building custom connectors.

Discoverable answers and Liveboards are now GA and on by default. You can now easily and immediately make content available to your team members. Use the *Make this [answer | Liveboard] discoverable* checkbox that appears when you save or share an answer or Liveboard to grant _view_ access to your teammates. Teammates can then view your answer or Liveboard in the list of relevant results when they use *Search Answers*, and see your content on their home page once viewed.

//update image here -- we need it to be zoomed in on the display name section. box around the profile icon and the display name feature. no need for this to be full screen -- capture it smaller than full screen so that the profile icon is a lot closer to the profile section itself. the nav bar currently looks like the software nav bar -- if you can't get an instance on cloud, copy/paste the cloud nav bar onto software image

// add additional step: 1. click profile icon. 2. click the edit button next to name
