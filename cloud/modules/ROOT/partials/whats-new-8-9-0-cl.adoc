[#8-9-0-cl-discoverable-content]
[discrete]
=== Discoverable answers and Liveboards

// Naomi

You can now make content easily available to your team members when you save or share an answer or Liveboard. Use the *Make this [answer | Liveboard] discoverable* checkbox that appears when you save or share an answer or Liveboard to grant _view_ access to your teammates. Any user who has access to the underlying data source (worksheet, table, view) and is part of the same user group as the author of the content, will be able to discover and access the answer or Liveboard in *Search Answers*.

Select this checkbox to publish your content in the list of relevant results when a teammate uses the *Search Answers* feature, or de-select to keep your content private.

=== ThoughtSpot Sync Salesforce connection

// Naomi-- likely but not fully confirmed for 8.9.0.cl

You can now sync data directly from an answer or custom SQL view to Salesforce. Using ThoughtSpot Sync, you can push insights directly to Salesforce, notify your teams, and view data in context. ThoughtSpot Sync automatically establishes a secure pipeline to the destination app and thus eliminates the need for building custom connectors.
