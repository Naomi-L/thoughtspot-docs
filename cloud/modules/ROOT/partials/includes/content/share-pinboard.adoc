When you share a Liveboard, you share a live link to the Liveboard that reflects the latest version of it.
When someone else views the Liveboard you shared with them, they see the most recently saved version with the most recent data.

You do not have to be an administrator or the Liveboard's owner to share saved Liveboards.
Any user can share them, based on the access levels the user has.

You can share a Liveboard from the list of Liveboards on <<share-mainpinboardpage,the main Liveboards page>>, or from <<share-pinboardpage,the Liveboard itself>>.
