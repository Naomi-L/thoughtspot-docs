=== Mandatory Liveboard filters

Mandatory Liveboard filters are now GA. Mark certain filters in your Liveboard as mandatory. If you add mandatory filters to a Liveboard, the visualizations will only load after Liveboard viewers select values for the mandatory filters. Use mandatory filters for Liveboards that contain data that may not be relevant for everyone who must view and consume the Liveboard. Mandatory filters also lower query and performance costs. To try the feature out, select *Mandatory filter* when adding a filter to a Liveboard. For more information about mandatory filters, see
ifndef::pendo-links[]
xref:liveboard-filters-mandatory.adoc[Mandatory Liveboard filters].
