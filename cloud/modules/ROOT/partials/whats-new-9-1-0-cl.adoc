=== Mandatory Liveboard filters

Mandatory Liveboard filters are now GA. Mark certain filters in your Liveboard as mandatory. If you add mandatory filters to a Liveboard, the visualizations will only load after Liveboard viewers select values for the mandatory filters. Use mandatory filters for Liveboards that contain data that may not be relevant for everyone who must view and consume the Liveboard. Mandatory filters also lower query and performance costs. To try the feature out, select *Mandatory filter* when adding a filter to a Liveboard. For more information about mandatory filters, see

[#9-1-0-cl-kpi-explain-change]
[discrete]
=== Explain change for KPI charts

// Naomi--  was beta in 8.8.

KPI explain change is now GA and on by default. You can now use SpotIQ analysis to directly identify the key drivers for recent change in your KPIs. KPI change analysis allows you to drill down into the causes of change in your KPIs and customize the insights generated by SpotIQ.

To access this feature, go to your KPI chart and select the caret icon to the right of the percent change label. The *Run change analysis* pop-up allows you to customize the columns ThoughtSpot analyzes. Note that ThoughtSpot runs change analysis between the two most recent data points defined by the KPI’s time bucket (for example, `daily` or `weekly`).

For more information on change analysis,

[#9-1-0-cl-kpi-comparison]
[discrete]
=== Custom comparison points for KPI charts

// Naomi

You can now set your KPI chart to display a percent change comparison between the most recent data point and a custom comparison point. For example, when searching for `sales monthly`, you can choose to see percent change between this month and the previous month, previous quarter, or previous year. For more information, see

[#9-1-0-cl-group-aggregate]
[discrete]
=== Group aggregation enhancements: filters

// Naomi

Group aggregate filter enhancements are GA and on by default. Previously, when using group_aggregate formulas, users could use query_filters to include filters entered in the search bar in the formula's value, but it was difficult to write a formula that accepted filters from only a single column.

Starting with this release, you can specify column names within the ‘filters’ section of a group_aggregate formula, and any filter in your search bar referencing that column will be added to the formula. Filters entered in the search bar that are not on columns specified in the third argument of the group_aggregate formula will be ignored. For details, see
