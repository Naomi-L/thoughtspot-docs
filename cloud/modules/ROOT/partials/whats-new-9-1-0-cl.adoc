[#9-1-0-cl-mandatory-filters]
[discrete]
=== Mandatory Liveboard filters

Mandatory Liveboard filters are now GA. Mark certain filters in your Liveboard as mandatory. If you add mandatory filters to a Liveboard, the visualizations will only load after Liveboard viewers select values for the mandatory filters. Use mandatory filters for Liveboards that contain data that may not be relevant for everyone who must view and consume the Liveboard. Mandatory filters also lower query and performance costs. To try the feature out, select *Mandatory filter* when adding a filter to a Liveboard. For more information about mandatory filters, see
ifndef::pendo-links[]
xref:liveboard-filters-mandatory.adoc[Mandatory Liveboard filters].
endif::[]

[#9-1-0-cl-kpi-comparison]
[discrete]
=== Custom comparison points for KPI charts

// Naomi

You can now set your KPI chart to display a percent change comparison between the most recent data point and a custom comparison point. For example, when searching for `sales monthly`, you can choose to see percent change between this month and the previous month, previous quarter, or previous year. For more information, see

[#9-1-0-cl-kpi-explain-change]
[discrete]
=== Explain change for KPI charts

// Naomi--  was beta in 8.8.

KPI explain change is now GA. You can now use SpotIQ analysis to directly identify the key drivers for recent change in your KPIs. KPI change analysis allows you to drill down into the causes of change in your KPIs and customize the insights generated by SpotIQ.

To access this feature, go to your KPI chart and select the caret icon to the right of the percent change label. The *Run change analysis* pop-up allows you to customize the columns ThoughtSpot analyzes.

For more information on change analysis,
ifndef::pendo-links[]

[#9-1-0-cl-parameters]
[discrete]
=== Parameters

The parameters feature is now GA. Create Worksheet parameters to optimize your data inquiries. Use parameters to run different scenarios with adjustable values, without creating or modifying the constants in formulas for each new value. For example, easily adjust the attribute in an Answer to view your revenue by commit date or order date, as in the following gif. To try it out, edit a Worksheet, and select the *+* button that appears when you hover over the *Parameters* section. For more information about parameters, see
ifndef::pendo-links[]
xref:parameters-create.adoc[Creating parameters] and xref:parameters-use.adoc[Using parameters].

[#9-1-0-cl-multiple-changes]
[discrete]
=== Apply multiple chart changes at once

// Naomi

Apply change is now GA. Now users can make multiple configurations and apply them at the same time rather than waiting in between each configuration. When creating a visualization with multiple fields, users often need to make multiple rearrangements to reach a desired chart. For more information, see
ifndef::pendo-links[]
xref:chart-multiple-changes.adoc[Multiple chart changes].
endif::[]
ifdef::pendo-links[]
xref:chart-multiple-changes.adoc[Multiple chart changes,window=_blank].

// specify that this is now GA. add image of apply button. put positive sentence at the beginning (now users can make multiple configs...). maybe take that first sentence out entirely?

image::apply-change.png[Apply multiple changes]

[#9-1-0-cl-heatmap]
[discrete]
=== Disable heatmap data labels

Optionally disable heatmap charts' data labels, and understand the chart quickly by scanning the heatmap colors. This makes complex heatmap charts with many data values easier to read. To try it out, create a heatmap chart, select the *edit chart configuration* icon image:icon-gear-10px.png[edit chart configuration icon image], select *Settings*, and unselect *All labels*.
For more information, see
ifndef::pendo-links[]
xref:chart-heatmap.adoc#labels[Heatmap charts].

[#9-1-0-cl-resolution]
[discrete]
=== Scheduled or downloaded Liveboard PDF width

By default, scheduled and downloaded Liveboard PDFs now render at a width of 1920 pixels. This ensures that the Liveboard you see in ThoughtSpot and the Liveboard PDF you download or schedule looks the same. You can also change this default width to a different width for your company, by contacting {support-url}. To try the new default width out, download a PDF of a Liveboard. For more information, see
ifndef::pendo-links[]

[#9-1-0-cl-download]
[discrete]
=== Specify format when downloading charts and tables

// Naomi

When downloading a table or chart, you can now specify the file format. You can download tables in XLSX, CSV, or PDF format, and download charts in XLSX, CSV, or PNG format. To try it out, open a chart or table, and select *Download* from the *more options* menu image:icon-more-10px.png[ellipsis icon].

// specify additional file formats, not just specify file formats. for tables you can already download all of these formats. ask PM about value prop. maybe a pic? update title. more download options for charts and tables or something

// new option in "Download" item on more options menu, lets you download in different formats (XLSX, CSV, PDF when table view, XLSX, CSV, PNG when in chart view). applicable wherever there are chart download options (Liveboards, explore, spotIQ)

[#9-1-0-cl-labels]
[discrete]
=== Data labels on a dark background
Data labels on a dark background are now GA. Labels that appear on a dark background now display in a lighter text color, making them easier to read. To try it out, navigate to Search data and *Create a chart* > *Change the chart color*, and *Add labels*.

image::chartconfig-data-labels-on-dark-background.png[Labels appear on dark background]

// no link because this just requires a release note -- is that okay?

[#9-1-0-cl-filter]
[discrete]
=== Change filter order for Liveboard filters

Arrange Liveboard filters in the filter bar so that they are in a logical, coherent order, by dragging and dropping them to different spots in the list. This makes it easier for viewers of the Liveboard to understand and use the filters on the Liveboard. To try it out, edit any Liveboard, and drag and drop the filters in the filter bar.
For more information, see
ifndef::pendo-links[]
xref:liveboard-filters.adoc#order[Change the filter order].
endif::[]
ifdef::pendo-links[]
xref:liveboard-filters.adoc#order[Change the filter order,window=_blank].
endif::[]

=== Change analysis and SpotIQ privilege

// Naomi

All users can now use SpotIQ to run
ifndef::pendo-links[]
xref:spotiq-change.adoc[change analysis],
endif::[]
ifdef::pendo-links[]
xref:spotiq-change.adoc[cchange analysis,window=_blank],

// change analysis no longer requires SpotIQ privileges-- all users will be able to do change analysis and access SpotIQ tab. Auto analyse will be privilege-specific.

[#9-1-0-cl-or]
[discrete]
=== Text keywords enhancements

We improved the syntax of our text keywords, such as `begins with` and `contains`, to make it easier to choose whether ThoughtSpot combines keyword phrases with `or` logic or `and` logic.
For more information, see the
ifndef::pendo-links[]
xref:keywords.adoc#text[Keyword reference].
endif::[]
ifdef::pendo-links[]

endif::[]

// check what the code looks like and change to bold or italics if necessary

// move keywords features next to each other



[#9-1-0-cl-group-aggregate]
[discrete]
=== Group aggregation enhancements: filters

// Naomi

Group aggregate filter enhancements are GA. Previously, when using group_aggregate formulas, users could use query_filters to include filters entered in the search bar in the formula's value, but it was difficult to write a formula that accepted filters from only a single column.

Starting with this release, you can specify column names within the ‘filters’ section of a group_aggregate formula, and any filter in your search bar referencing that column will be added to the formula. Filters entered in the search bar that are not on columns specified in the third argument of the group_aggregate formula will be ignored. For details, see
ifndef::pendo-links[]
xref:formulas-aggregation-flexible.adoc#groupagg-filters-enhancement[Group aggregation filters].

[#9-1-0-cl-scheduled]
[discrete]
=== Remove attached files from scheduled emails

// Naomi-- GA

For data security, you may choose to remove attached files from all scheduled Liveboard emails, so that users need to sign in to view updates in Liveboards they follow. When this feature is enabled, scheduled Liveboard email recipients will receive an email with a link to the Liveboard, which they will need to sign in to see. To ensure that only signed-in users can access your data, contact ThoughtSpot Support to enable this option. For more information, see
