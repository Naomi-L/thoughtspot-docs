[#9-1-0-cl-mandatory-filters]
[discrete]
=== Mandatory Liveboard filters

Mandatory Liveboard filters are now GA. Mark certain filters in your Liveboard as mandatory. If you add mandatory filters to a Liveboard, the visualizations will only load after Liveboard viewers select values for the mandatory filters. Use mandatory filters for Liveboards that contain data that may not be relevant for everyone who must view and consume the Liveboard. Mandatory filters also lower query and performance costs.

[#9-1-0-cl-kpi-comparison]
[discrete]
=== Custom comparison points for KPI charts

// Naomi

You can now set your KPI chart to display a percent change comparison between the most recent data point and a custom comparison point. For example, when searching for `sales monthly`, you can choose to see percent change between this month and the previous month, previous quarter, or previous year.

[#9-0-0-cl-sync]
[discrete]
=== ThoughtSpot Sync

// Naomi

You can now use ThoughtSpot Sync to sync data directly from an Answer or custom SQL view to the following apps:

* Gainsight
* Zoho

[#9-1-0-cl-data-workspace]
[discrete]
=== Schedule ThoughtSpot Sync

// Naomi

When scheduling a sync with an external app, you can now choose to schedule every 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 45 minutes.


[#9-1-0-cl-kpi-explain-change]
[discrete]
=== Change analysis for KPI charts

// Naomi--  was beta in 8.8.

KPI change analysis is now GA. You can now use change analysis to directly identify the key drivers for recent change in your KPIs.

To access this feature, go to your KPI chart and select the caret icon to the right of the percent change label. The *Run change analysis* pop-up allows you to customize the columns ThoughtSpot analyzes to identify the drivers of change. ThoughtSpot runs change analysis for the most recent data point, and the past comparison data point as per the KPI chart's configuration. Note that you need SpotIQ privileges to use the KPI change analysis feature.

[#9-1-0-cl-multiple-changes]
[discrete]
=== Apply multiple chart changes at once

// Naomi

The *Apply* button is now GA. Now users can make multiple configurations and apply them at the same time rather than waiting in between each configuration.

image::apply-change.png[Apply multiple changes]


[#9-1-0-cl-heatmap]
[discrete]
=== Disable heatmap data labels

Optionally disable heatmap charts' data labels, and understand the chart quickly by scanning the heatmap colors. This makes complex heatmap charts with many data values easier to read.

ifdef::free-trial-feature[]
[#9-1-0-cl-free-trial-row-limits]
[discrete]
=== Free Trial - Show row limits

// Naomi. Free trial only

When using Free Trial and Team Edition, users are limited to a maximum of 5 million rows. You can now check to see what percent of the row limit you are using, under **Admin > Data usage**.

image:ft-row.png[Show row limits on Free Trial]
endif::free-trial-feature[]

[#9-1-0-cl-download]
[discrete]
=== Specify format when downloading charts and tables

// Naomi

We streamlined the file format options when downloading tables and charts from ThoughtSpot. You can download tables in XLSX, CSV, or PDF format, and download charts in XLSX, CSV, or PNG format. To try it out, open a chart or table, and select *Download* from the *more options* menu image:icon-more-10px.png[ellipsis icon].

[#9-1-0-cl-data-panel]
[discrete]
=== Data Literacy : New Data Panel experience for Multiple Sources

// Mark



[#9-1-0-cl-labels]
[discrete]
=== Data labels on a dark background
Data labels on a dark background are now GA and on by default. Labels that appear on a dark background now display in a lighter text color, making them easier to read.

image::chartconfig-data-labels-on-dark-background.png[Labels appear on dark background]

[#9-1-0-cl-filter]
[discrete]
=== Change filter order for Liveboard filters

Arrange Liveboard filters in the filter bar so that they are in a logical, coherent order, by dragging and dropping them to different spots in the list. This makes it easier for viewers of the Liveboard to understand and use the filters on the Liveboard.

image::filter-reorder.gif[Filter reorder gif]


[#9-1-0-cl-spotiq]
[discrete]
=== Change analysis and SpotIQ privilege

// Naomi

[#9-1-0-cl-or]
[discrete]
=== Text keywords enhancements

We improved the syntax of our text keywords, such as `begins with` and `contains`, to provide users with more flexibility. For example, the `contains` keyword now accepts expressions such as `product name contains 'shoes' or 'snickers'`.

Additionally, if your query includes two or more `contains` phrases that modify the same column, ThoughtSpot now combines the phrases using `or` logic, instead of `and`. If you have existing Answers or visualizations using this `and` logic, ThoughtSpot will automatically update your queries after you upgrade to 9.1.0.cl, to ensure they return the same information.

[#9-1-0-cl-french]
[discrete]
=== Improvements to French keywords
This release improves the translated French keywords.


[#9-1-0-cl-group-aggregate]
[discrete]
=== Group aggregation enhancements: filters

// Naomi

Group aggregate filter enhancements are GA. Previously, when using group_aggregate formulas, users could use query_filters to include filters entered in the search bar in the formula's value, but it was difficult to write a formula that accepted filters from only a single column.

Starting with this release, you can specify column names within the ‘filters’ section of a group_aggregate formula, and any filter in your search bar referencing that column will be added to the formula. Filters entered in the search bar that are not on columns specified in the third argument of the group_aggregate formula will be ignored.

[#9-1-0-cl-mobile]
[discrete]
=== Mobile App load more button

// Naomi

When using ThoughtSpot Mobile, you can now press the *Load More* button at the bottom of a table to see the next 100 rows of data.

[#9-1-0-cl-timezone]
[discrete]
=== Specify time zone when scheduling Liveboards

// Naomi

When scheduling Liveboards, you can now specify your time zone.

=== _Other features and enhancements_

[#9-1-0-cl-disaster-recovery]
[discrete]
=== Cross-Region Disaster Recovery

Cross-Region Disaster Recovery allows ThoughtSpot to recover your ThoughtSpot cluster in a secondary AWS region in the case of a failure of the primary AWS region where the cluster is running. This ensures that if one AWS region fails, ThoughtSpot can start your application in another region, guaranteeing minimal downtime.

[#9-1-0-cl-parameters]
[discrete]
=== Parameters

The parameters feature is now GA. Create Worksheet parameters to optimize your data inquiries. Use parameters to run different scenarios with adjustable values, without creating or modifying the constants in formulas for each new value. For example, easily adjust the attribute in an Answer to view your revenue by commit date or order date, as in the following gif.

image::parameter-2.gif[Parameter gif example]

[#9-1-0-cl-custom-map]
[discrete]
=== Upload custom geo maps

Custom geo maps are now GA. Upload your own custom maps and visualize data on geo charts with regions that are specific to you and your organization.

image::custom-map-search-example.png[Custom geo map being added, and a ThoughtSpot search using the custom map]

[#9-1-0-cl-scheduled]
[discrete]
=== Remove attached files from scheduled emails

// Naomi-- GA

For data security, you may choose to remove attached files from all scheduled Liveboard emails, so that users need to sign in to view updates in Liveboards they follow. When this feature is enabled, scheduled Liveboard email recipients will receive an email with a link to the Liveboard, which they will need to sign in to see. To ensure that only signed-in users can access your data, contact ThoughtSpot Support to enable this option.

// is this in beta?

// move to second half

[#9-1-0-cl-sql-server]
[discrete]
=== SQL Server connection

// Naomi

You can now create connections from ThoughtSpot to SQL Server.


[#9-1-0-cl-resolution]
[discrete]
=== Scheduled or downloaded Liveboard PDF width

By default, scheduled and downloaded Liveboard PDFs now render at a width of 1920 pixels. This ensures that most Liveboard PDFs you download or schedule look the same as the Liveboards you see in ThoughtSpot. You can also change this default width to a different width for your company, by contacting {support-url}.


ifndef::free-trial-feature[]
[#9-1-0-cl-object-usage]
[discrete]
=== Object Usage Liveboard

// Naomi

Use the Object Usage Liveboard to easily track how specific objects (Liveboards, Answers, Worksheets, or tables) are trending over time. Our new visualizations allow you to understand adoption on the object level, and filter on a specific user or users to see usage on the user level.

image::object-usage-whats-new.png[Object Usage Liveboard]

[#9-1-0-cl-tml-monitor]
[discrete]
=== TML for Monitor alerts

TML for Monitor alerts is now GA. Export, edit, and import KPI Monitor alerts programmatically, using ThoughtSpot Modeling Language.

[#9-1-0-cl-join-tml]
[discrete]
=== Edit join conditions using TML

Use TML to directly edit a join condition by editing the TML file's *on* parameter. This replaces the existing process of deleting and recreating the join in TML or the ThoughtSpot application.

[#9-1-0-cl-delete-tml]
[discrete]
=== Delete table columns using TML

Remove columns from tables in ThoughtSpot by deleting them in the tables' TML files.

[#9-1-0-cl-join-creation]
[discrete]
=== Join creation for views

// Naomi. Maybe not in the what's new? old join pop-up from views will now be the "new" join UI-- redirect to a join creation page

We standardized the method of creating joins for all data objects in ThoughtSpot. When creating a join from a view, users are now directed to a *Create join* page where they can choose a connection type, name the join, and map the source and destination columns.

// ask pm if we want this in the what's new or the release notes. if it simplifies creation, we might want it
