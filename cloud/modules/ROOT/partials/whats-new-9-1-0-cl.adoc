[#9-1-0-cl-mandatory-filters]
[discrete]
=== Mandatory Liveboard filters

Mandatory Liveboard filters are now GA. Mark certain filters in your Liveboard as mandatory. If you add mandatory filters to a Liveboard, the visualizations will only load after Liveboard viewers select values for the mandatory filters. Use mandatory filters for Liveboards that contain data that may not be relevant for everyone who must view and consume the Liveboard. Mandatory filters also lower query and performance costs.

[#9-1-0-cl-custom-map]
[discrete]
=== Upload custom geo maps

Upload your own custom maps and visualize data on geo charts with regions that are specific to you and your organization.

[#9-1-0-cl-parameters]
[discrete]
=== Parameters

The parameters feature is now GA. Create Worksheet parameters to optimize your data inquiries. Use parameters to run different scenarios with adjustable values, without creating or modifying the constants in formulas for each new value. For example, easily adjust the attribute in an Answer to view your revenue by commit date or order date, as in the following gif.

[#9-1-0-cl-resolution]

image::chartconfig-data-labels-on-dark-background.png[Labels appear on dark background]

[#9-1-0-cl-filter]
[discrete]
=== Change filter order for Liveboard filters

Arrange Liveboard filters in the filter bar so that they are in a logical, coherent order, by dragging and dropping them to different spots in the list. This makes it easier for viewers of the Liveboard to understand and use the filters on the Liveboard.
