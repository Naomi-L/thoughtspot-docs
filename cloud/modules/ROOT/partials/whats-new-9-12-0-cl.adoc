=== New home page
// Mark – SCAL-201641. switch gif for a video (test embedding wistia in a partial). moved to 9.12.5.cl
// PM: Adi

Starting in this release, we have a completely redesigned home page, where you can ask natural-language questions with Sage, view your watchlist, favorites, library of Answers and Liveboards, and more. With the new left-hand navigation, you can go directly to your Liveboards, Answers, SpotIQ Analysis, and Monitor Subscriptions.

=== New navigation
// are new navigation and home page disabled by default? confirm. apparently new homepage and nav are enabled at cluster level but disabled or not enabled for the user. AVAILABLE by default, but users have to enable it. administrators can disable it for their cluster.

The new global navigation organizes ThoughtSpot into different contextual sections designed for the common types of ThoughtSpot users. Within each app, there is left-hand navigation. These different sections are called apps, and you navigate to them using the app switcher image:app_switcher_icon.png[app switcher icon].

// Need new png

The new home page and navigation are disabled by default. To enable it, contact your ThoughtSpot administrator. After that, open your user profile, and in the _Experience_ section, set the Navigation and Homepage to *New experience*.

You can now conversationally search ThoughtSpot using natural language, asking follow-up questions for further clarification or to take your analysis in a new direction. This conversational approach allows you to begin with a simple question, and ask successive questions to refine the answer you receive. ThoughtSpot translates each natural language question into a query, and answers in chart format.

// PM: Manan

In addition to using conditional formatting to visually highlight a threshold in a measure (for example, `sales > 10000`), you can now use conditional formatting to compare a column's measures to another column or to a parameter. For example, if you search for `sales this year` compared to `sales last year`, you can highlight where sales this year were less than last year. You can set multiple conditional formatting rules to a single table. To enable this feature, contact your administrator.

Personalized columns are now available to all users and on by default.

* Using ThoughtSpot Sync, you can now sync data directly from an Answer or a custom SQL view, to Excel.
* You can now click the preview link when you create a Sync from the Data Workspace to see a preview of the resulting Answer, Liveboard, or Custom SQL view. Answer, Liveboard, and Custom SQL view previews appear in a new tab.
* When running a Sync, you can see the following information depending on the destination:

** Slack: channel name
