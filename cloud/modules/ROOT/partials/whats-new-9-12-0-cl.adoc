// Naomi -- scal-177005. is it visualization as well as table? check if it's in early access panel. moved to 9.12.0.cl

// PM: Manan

Rather than simply using conditional formatting comparing a column's measures to a single value (for example, `sales > 10000`), you can now use conditional formatting to compare a column's measures to another column or to a parameter. For example, if you search for `sales this year` compared to `sales last year`, you can highlight where sales this year were less than last year. You can set multiple conditional formatting rules to a single table. To enable this feature, contact your administrator.

Starting in this release, we have a completely redesigned home page, where you can ask natural-language questions with Sage, view your watchlist, favorites, library of Answers and Liveboards, and more.

=== New navigation

The new global navigation organizes ThoughtSpot into different contextual sections designed for the common types of ThoughtSpot users. Within each app, there is left-hand navigation. These different sections are called apps, and you navigate to them using the app switcher image:app_switcher_icon.png[app switcher icon].

// Need new png

The new home page navigation is disabled by default. To enable it, contact your ThoughtSpot administrator. After that, open your user profile, and in the _Experience_ section, set the Navigation and Homepage to *New experience*.

You can now use SpotIQ analysis to forecast future trends for your KPIs. ThoughtSpot uses machine learning models that learn from past trends, growth, and seasonality to project how the target metric will trend in the future. Note that your KPI must include a time keyword to support forecasting.

Personalized columns are now available to all users and on by default.

You can now drill down on specific columns in change analysis, in order to identify change drivers within your data.
