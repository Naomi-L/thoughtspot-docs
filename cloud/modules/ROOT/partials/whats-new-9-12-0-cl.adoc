// PM: Manan

Rather than simply using conditional formatting comparing a column's measures to a single value (for example, `sales > 10000`), you can now use conditional formatting to compare a column's measures to another column or to a parameter. For example, if you search for `sales this year` compared to `sales last year`, you can highlight where sales this year were less than last year. You can set multiple conditional formatting rules to a single table. To enable this feature, contact your administrator.

You can now use SpotIQ analysis to forecast future trends for your KPIs. ThoughtSpot uses machine learning models that learn from past trends, growth, and seasonality to project how the target metric will trend in the future. Note that your KPI must include a time keyword to support forecasting.

You can now conversationally search ThoughtSpot using natural language, asking follow-up questions for further clarification or to take your analysis in a new direction. This conversational approach allows you to begin with a simple question, and ask successive questions to refine the answer you receive. ThoughtSpot translates each natural language question into a query, and answers in chart format.
