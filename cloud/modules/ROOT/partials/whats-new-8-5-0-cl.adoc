[#8-5-0-cl-spotapps]
*SpotApps*

SpotApps are now GA and on by default. SpotApps are ThoughtSpotâ€™s new out-of-the-box solution templates built for specific use cases and data sources. They are built on ThoughtSpot Modeling Language (TML) Blocks, which are pre-built pieces of code that are easy to download and implement directly from the product.

SpotApps mimic the data models of the applications they are based on, such as ServiceNow or Jira. After you connect to your data in your cloud data warehouse, ThoughtSpot maps that data to SpotApp columns, and creates pre-built but still customizable worksheets, answers, and Liveboards, based on your data.

The following SpotApps are now available:

* Databricks Storage Management
* GBQ Performance and Consumption
* Google Analytics
* HubSpot Email Marketing
* JIRA Issue Management
* JIRA Sprint Management
* Okta Application Management
* Redshift Performance and Consumption
* ServiceNow Incident Management
* Snowflake Performance and Consumption
