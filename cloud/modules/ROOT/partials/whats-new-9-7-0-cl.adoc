You can now use SpotIQ analysis to directly identify the key drivers for recent change in your KPIs in ThoughtSpot Mobile. KPI change analysis allows you to drill down into the causes of change in your KPIs and customize the insights generated by SpotIQ.

To access this feature, go to your KPI chart and select the caret icon to the right of the percent change label. The *Run change analysis* pop-up allows you to customize the columns ThoughtSpot analyzes. Note that ThoughtSpot runs change analysis between the two most recent data points defined by the KPIâ€™s time bucket (for example, `daily` or `weekly`).

[#9-7-0-cl-nav]
[discrete]
=== New persona-based navigation [.badge.badge-early-access-whats-new]#Early Access#
endif::[]

In this release, we introduce a completely redesigned navigation experience organized by persona. The new app switcher allows business users, analysts, data engineers, IT Ops, and developers to work in separate contextual sections designed specifically for their needs. In addition, the navigation within each app is on the left to create better consistency and ease of use for users switching between the different apps. The Search Data button has been renamed Open Query Builder to more easily distinguish it from the Sage search bar, and it is now in the left-hand navigation of the Insights app. When switching to a different app, that app is opened in a new browser tab.

This new navigation experience is disabled by default, but you can enable it in your user profile.

The newly redesigned home page is part of the new Insights app, where you can ask natural-language questions with Sage, view your watchlist, favorites, library of Answers and Liveboards, and more. With the new left-hand navigation, you can go directly to your Liveboards, Answers, SpotIQ Analysis, and Monitor Subscriptions. The redesigned home page is part of the new persona-based navigation, in this release.

This new home page experience is disabled by default, but you can enable it in your user profile.
