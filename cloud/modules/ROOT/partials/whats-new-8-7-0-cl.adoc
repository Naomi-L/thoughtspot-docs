In this release, ThoughtSpot switched to a new, industry-standard cloud identity and access management method through Okta. This switch involves several external improvements to authentication:

* New local users now create their own password during activation. Administrators do not create the password prior to activation. For more information,

see xref:user-account-activation-okta.adoc[Activate your ThoughtSpot account].

* Ability to map IDP attributes for SAML authentication from the ThoughtSpot Admin Console (username, email, and display name). For more information,

* Account activation monitoring from the Users section of the Admin Console: if a user still needs to activate their account, administrators can see that information in the Users section and re-send their activation email. For more information,
