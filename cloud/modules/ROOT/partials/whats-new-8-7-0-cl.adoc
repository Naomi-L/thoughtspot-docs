=== Threshold-based alerts

// Naomi

Threshold-based alerts are now GA and on by default. You can now use the Monitor feature to receive alerts when your KPI satisfies a given threshold condition. For example, create a condition to receive an alert when your Sales KPI becomes `greater than 200,000`, or when your KPI for Sales weekly `increases by 2%`.
