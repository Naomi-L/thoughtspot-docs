[#8-7-0-cl-threshold-alerts]
[discrete]
=== Threshold-based alerts

// Naomi -- still waiting for confirmation

// check if you have a note about trying it out that is different in beta vs GA

Threshold-based alerts are now GA and on by default. You can now use the Monitor feature to receive alerts when your KPI satisfies a given threshold condition. For example, create a condition to receive an alert when your Sales KPI becomes `greater than 200,000`, or when your KPI for Sales weekly `increases by 2%`.
