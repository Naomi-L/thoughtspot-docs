[#8-7-0-cl-threshold-alerts]

=== Threshold-based alerts

Threshold-based alerts are now GA and on by default. You can now use the Monitor feature to receive alerts when your KPI satisfies a given threshold condition. For example, create a condition to receive an alert when your Sales KPI becomes `greater than 200,000`, or when your KPI for Sales weekly `increases by 2%`.

You can now sync data directly from an Answer, View, or Liveboard to external business apps like Google Sheets, Slack, or Microsoft Teams. Using ThoughtSpot Sync, you can push insights directly to your app, notify your teams, and view data in context. ThoughtSpot Sync automatically establishes a secure pipeline to the destination app and thus eliminates the need for building custom connectors to external apps. For more information,

endif::[]

// confirm again that this will be in 8.7. rename all this to iam v2 instead of okta

In this release, ThoughtSpot switched to a new, industry-standard cloud identity and access management method through Okta. This switch involves several external improvements to authentication:

* New local users now create their own password during activation. Administrators do not create the password prior to activation. For more information,
ifndef::pendo-links[]
see xref:user-account-activation-okta.adoc[Activate your ThoughtSpot account].

ifdef::pendo-links[]
see xref:user-account-activation-okta.adoc[Activate your ThoughtSpot account,window=_blank].
endif::[]

* Ability to map IDP attributes for SAML authentication from the ThoughtSpot Admin Console (username, email, and display name). For more information,

//maybe figure out a way to zoom here (gif?) or just screenshot the relevant parts and have a smaller browser window
* Account activation monitoring from the Users section of the Admin Console: if a user still needs to activate their account, administrators can see that information in the Users section and re-send their activation email. For more information,
ifndef::pendo-links[]
see xref:user-management.adoc[Create, edit, or delete a  user].
