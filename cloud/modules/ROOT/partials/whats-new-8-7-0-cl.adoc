=== Threshold-based alerts

// Naomi

Threshold-based alerts are now GA and on by default. You can now use the Monitor feature to receive alerts when your KPI satisfies a given threshold condition. For example, create a condition to receive an alert when your Sales KPI becomes `greater than 200,000`, or when your KPI for Sales weekly `increases by 2%`.

=== Geo charts enhancements

This release includes several enhancements to all geo charts:

* Improved map quality: This includes faster map loading, better clarity, and more granular details down to the street level when you zoom in. This applies to background maps (the parts of the map with no data) as well.
* A new *map type* option that allows you to customize the display of the parts of the geo chart map that do not contain data. The new map type options are Light, Dark, Outdoors, Streets, Satellite, and Satellite Streets. The default is Light.

[#8-7-0-cl-or-contains]
[discrete]
=== Support for OR in contains operator

ThoughtSpot now offers the option to `OR` multiple `contains` clauses for the same attribute in a search, instead of combining them with `AND`, which is the default. For example, with the optional new `OR` behavior, `country name contains 'a' country name contains 'b'` returns results such as `Azerbaijan`, `Bahrain`, `North America`, and `Canada`. With the default `AND` behavior, that search returns `Azerbaijan` and `Bahrain`, but *_not_* `North America` or `Canada`.

To enable this feature, contact {support-url}.

[#8-7-0-cl-sources]
[discrete]
=== Choose sources limitation

You can no longer select more than 100 data sources to search on when searching data. This maximum of 100 sources improves performance and limits timeouts due to the selection of too many sources.

=== ThoughtSpot Sync [.badge.badge-update]#Beta#

// Naomi

You can now sync data directly from an answer or custom SQL view to an external business app like Google Sheets, Slack, or Microsoft Teams. Using ThoughtSpot Sync, you can push insights directly to your app, notify your teams, and view data in context. ThoughtSpot Sync automatically establishes a secure pipeline to the destination app and thus eliminates the need for building custom connectors to external apps.

[#8-7-0-cl-snowflake-csv]

=== CSV upload for Snowflake connections

You can now upload a CSV file that can be joined to your connection's tables in your Snowflake database.

// confirm again that this will be in 8.7.

In this release, ThoughtSpot switched to a new, industry-standard cloud identity and access management method through Okta. This switch involves several external improvements to authentication:

* New local users now create their own password during activation. Administrators do not create the password prior to activation.

* Ability to map IDP attributes for SAML authentication from the ThoughtSpot Admin Console (username, email, and display name).

* Account activation monitoring from the Users section of the Admin Console: if a user still needs to activate their account, administrators can see that information in the Users section and re-send their activation email.
