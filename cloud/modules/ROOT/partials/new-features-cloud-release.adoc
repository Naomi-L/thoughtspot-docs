[#8-1-0-cl-first]
=== For the First User

Getting started with ThoughtSpot Cloud::

=== For the Analyst

[#spotapps]
ServiceNow SpotApp::
SpotApps are ThoughtSpot's new out-of-the-box solution templates built for specific use cases and data sources. They are built on Blocks, which are pre-built pieces of code that are easy to download and implement directly from the product. This release introduces the ServiceNow SpotApp and Analytics Blocks. Analytics Blocks include pre-built Worksheet, Answer, and Liveboard Blocks.
+
The ServiceNow SpotApp mimics the ServiceNow data model. After you connect to your ServiceNow data in your cloud data warehouse, ThoughtSpot maps that data to SpotApp columns, and creates pre-built but still customizable worksheets, answers, and Liveboards, based on your ServiceNow data.
+
This feature is in beta and off by default. It is part of the <<data-tab,Data tab redesign>>, which is also in beta and off by default. To enable SpotApps and the Data tab redesign, contact {support-url}.

SQL-based views::
This release introduces beta support for SQL-based views. Users can create views based on SQL queries, and use those views as data sources. This type of view has the same functionality as a view based on searching your data.
+
This feature is in beta and off by default. To enable it, contact {support-url}.

[#data-tab]
Data tab redesign::
This release redesigns the *Data* section of the product. To access this part of the product, select *Data* from the top navigation bar. The redesign introduces several new features, such as SQL-based views and SpotApps, and makes the UI more intuitive.
+
This feature is in beta and off by default. To enable it,  contact {support-url}.

[#okta]
Okta authentication::

In this release, ThoughtSpot switched to a new, industry-standard cloud authentication method through Okta. Okta is now ThoughtSpotâ€™s internal authentication service. This change is internal and has no impact on customers. After we enable this feature by default, all user authentication will automatically use the internal Okta service.
+
This new Okta authentication feature is in *Beta*, and off by default. To enable it, contact {support-url}.
+
This switch involves several external improvements to authentication, including security enhancements:
+
* Ability to map IDP attributes from the ThoughtSpot Admin Console (username, email, and display name)
* Account activation monitoring from the Users section of the Admin Console: if a user still needs to activate their account, you can see that information in the Users section and re-send their activation email
* Only Okta interacts with your IDP. Your ThoughtSpot cluster does not directly interact with your IDP.
* Local users create their own password during activation. Administrators do not create the password prior to activation.

[#encryption-at-rest]
Encryption at rest::
ThoughtSpot provides advanced data encryption at rest (EAR) that allows for granular user and folder level controls for encrypting your persistent data. EAR is currently a beta feature. To enable EAR in your environment, contact {support-url}.
