[#january-cloud-2022-first]
=== For the First User

Getting started with ThoughtSpot Cloud::
The first user on the account has to complete a series of steps before other people can start using ThoughtSpot with your organization's data.
For these instructions, see xref:ts-cloud-getting-started.adoc[Getting Started with ThoughtSpot Cloud].

[#january-cloud-2022-analyst]
=== For the Analyst

New answer experience::
The xref:answer-experience-new.adoc[new answer experience] is now GA and on by default. The new answer experience contains the following features:
include::partial$new-answer-experience-features.adoc[]
+
include::partial$new-answer-experience-deprecations.adoc[]

Liveboard schedule::
ThoughtSpot now combines the Liveboard follow and xref:liveboard-schedule.adoc[Liveboard Schedule] features into a single action called "Schedule." To create a new schedule to receive an email containing a pdf of your Liveboard, users now select the *Schedule* button to the left of the *more options menu* image:icon-more-10px.png[].
This change allows any user to schedule their own Liveboard emails.
To send Liveboard emails to other users, users still need the xref:privileges-end-user.adoc#schedule-pinboards[Can schedule Liveboards permission].
+
ThoughtSpot will migrate any existing Liveboard follows to Liveboard schedules.
For users who followed a Liveboard in November Cloud or earlier, those Liveboard schedules appear in the list of Liveboard schedules as _Migrated from follow (your display name)_.

[#monitor-kpi]
Monitor Key Performance Indicators (KPI)::
ThoughtSpot now supports scheduled alerts for changes in Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in your data.

From the *Monitor* tab, you can view and manage all KPI alerts you create or subscribe to. For more information, see xref:monitor.adoc[].

[#chart-kpi]
KPI chart type::
You can now create visualizations of your dataâ€™s Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). ThoughtSpot automatically selects the KPI chart type when you search a single measure in your data.

Support for VMware Workspace One::

Auto-select search data source for new users::
When a new user uses xref:search-data.adoc[Search Data], ThoughtSpot intelligently selects a data source for them to search on. ThoughtSpot chooses the most popular data source in the cluster that the user has access to. This allows users to begin to search data easily, without looking through all the existing data sources on their cluster.
