[#8-8-0-cl-first]
=== For the First User

Getting started with ThoughtSpot Cloud::
The first user on the account has to complete a series of steps before other people can start using ThoughtSpot with your organization's data.
For these instructions, see xref:ts-cloud-getting-started.adoc[Getting Started with ThoughtSpot Cloud].

[#8-8-0-cl-analyst]
=== For the Analyst

Custom sizes for visualizations in Liveboards::
This release introduces custom tile sizes for visualizations within Liveboards. In addition to the 5 predetermined visualization sizes, you can now customize your Liveboard visualizations to be any size. See xref:liveboard-layout-edit.adoc#size[Edit the layout of a Liveboard].

Formula function search bar::
The formula editor assistant now contains a search bar for formula functions. Use it to search for specific functions to include in your formula. Refer to xref:formula-add.adoc[].

year_name function::
The new `year_name` formula function returns the year in string format for a given date. This improves the behavior of formulas involving years when using a custom calendar with year values that are not in integer format. Refer to xref:formula-reference.adoc#year_name[Formula function reference].

Headline summaries for discontinuous group aggregate formulas::
We changed the default behavior for table aggregation summaries when the search contains a formulas that contain both a conditional clause (`if... then... else`) and a group_aggregate expression. When a user searches with a formula containing both a conditional clause and a group_aggregate expression, then ThoughtSpot detects the aggregation type on the first non-constant output clause and uses it in the headline summary. In this context, a non-constant output clause means any fixed value (number or string).
+
For example, in the formula `group_aggregate(sum(if (Color = 'blue') then 0 else group_unique_count(Discount)))`, the headline summary would use `COUNT_DISTINCT`, since the first non-constant output column within the `if... then... else` clause is `group_unique_count` and has an aggregation type of `COUNT_DISTINCT`.

[#spotapps-8-9]
SpotApps::

The following SpotApps are now available:
* xref:spotapps-salesforce.adoc[Salesforce Pipeline Analysis]
* xref:spotapps-facebook.adoc[Facebook Ads]

[#8-8-0-cl-business-user]
=== For the Business User

Explain change for KPI charts::
You can now use SpotIQ analysis to directly identify the key drivers for recent change in your KPIs. To access this feature, go to your KPI chart and select the caret icon to the right of the percent change label. The *Run change analysis* pop-up allows you to customize the columns ThoughtSpot analyzes. Note that ThoughtSpot runs change analysis between the two most recent data points defined by the KPIâ€™s time bucket (for example, `daily` or `weekly`).
+
For more information on change analysis,
see xref:spotiq-comparative.adoc[Comparative analysis].


Apply tags from the Home page::
You can now apply and edit tags on Liveboards and answers directly from the Home page, as well as from the *Answers* and *Liveboards* tabs. To try it out, select the checkbox next to the name(s) of the answer(s) or Liveboard(s) you would like to tag and click the *Apply tags* button that appears. For more information, see xref:thoughtspot-one-homepage.adoc#object-tag[Home page].

Show underlying data improvements::
We have made the following improvements to the *Show underlying data* feature:

* When you right-click on a table and select *Show underlying data*, ThoughtSpot displays only the visualized columns.
* You can now open the *Show underlying data* pop-up and click *Edit columns* to add or remove columns from your query.
* When you open the *Edit columns* pop-up, you can now search for column names using the search bar.
* The *Show underlying data* pop-up no longer disables columns by default. To disable columns from your query, click *Edit columns* and deselect the column name(s).

Improvements to German keywords::
This release improves the translated German keywords. See xref:keywords-de-DE.adoc[].

[#8-8-0-cl-data-engineer]
=== For the Data Engineer

[#join-deletion]
Delete joins that have dependents::
You can now delete a join from the ThoughtSpot UI even if the join has dependents. Deleting the join does not delete the dependents. This allows you to delete a join and create it again in the other direction, without invalidating or deleting any dependent objects.
+
Refer to xref:relationship-delete.adoc[].

=== For the IT/Ops Engineer

* Admin users on updated clusters see a banner to sign ThoughtSpot's terms and conditions within 30 days. You can sign the agreement by clicking *Accept* on the banner, or from *Admin > Legal*.
