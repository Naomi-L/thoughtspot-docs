Glean integration:: You can now use Glean to search unstructured data, such as documents, PowerPoint, and Excel files, directly from a Liveboard. Add a Glean tile to your Liveboard to easily add context to your ThoughtSpot data insights. Glean inherits the filters and query terms defined by your Liveboard. You can configure Glean results to include or exclude these terms from your search. Glean results are tailored to each user based on their team, search activity, and preferences. For more information, see xref:glean-integration.adoc[Glean integration].

Run change analysis iteratively:: You can now drill down on specific columns in change analysis, in order to identify change drivers within your data. When you right-click on a column in the change analysis window to drill down, ThoughtSpot adds the column as a filter and re-calculates change analysis for the specific window of time specified in your original search. For more information, see xref:spotiq-change.adoc#iterative[Iterative change analysis].


// Naomi -- scal-156247
Natural language search chart type:: You can now specify the answering chart type when you use Natural Language Search. For example, search for "sales by region pie chart", and the results appear in pie chart format. For more information, see xref:ai-answers.adoc[].

Functional enhancements for verified Liveboards:: Easily find verified Liveboards marked with banners, and icons. Sort search results to view content tagged as verified.

Roles and more granular access privileges:: ThoughtSpot introduces role-based access control (RBAC) to allow for more granular access privileges. Use roles to apply privileges customized for your organizational needs.

Mobile enhancements:: We made the following improvements to ThoughtSpot mobile:

* We simplified the log in process for the ThoughtSpot mobile app. You can now enter your company email to receive an email with a magic link login, rather than entering the server URL.
* ThoughtSpot now supports IAMv2 login.
* You can now change your ThoughtSpot locale through the Mobile app. When your locale is updated, ThoughtSpot translates labels, date formats and number formats to match the default for your country and language.
* You can now use SpotIQ analysis to directly identify the key drivers for recent change in your KPIs in ThoughtSpot Mobile. KPI change analysis allows you to drill down into the causes of change in your KPIs and customize the insights generated by SpotIQ.
To access this feature, go to your KPI chart and select the caret icon to the right of the percent change label. The *Run change analysis* pop-up allows you to customize the columns ThoughtSpot analyzes. Note that ThoughtSpot runs change analysis between the two most recent data points defined by the KPIâ€™s time bucket (for example, `daily` or `weekly`).
* We introduced improved deep linking to ThoughtSpot mobile. When you click a link you no longer need to choose whether you want to view the link in your default mobile browser or the ThoughtSpot app. The default behavior is to open the link in ThoughtSpot if it is supported.
* You can now receive ThoughtSpot mobile push notifications. Receive push notifications when a Liveboard or Answer is shared with you. Monitor scheduled and threshold alerts with push notifications.
