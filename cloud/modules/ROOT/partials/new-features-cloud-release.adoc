[#9-2-0-cl-first]
=== For the First User

Getting started with ThoughtSpot Cloud::
The first user on the account has to complete a series of steps before other people can start using ThoughtSpot with your organization's data.
For these instructions, see xref:ts-cloud-getting-started.adoc[Getting Started with ThoughtSpot Cloud].

[#9-2-0-cl-analyst]
=== For the Analyst

Liveboard note tiles [.badge.badge-early-access-relnotes]#Early Access#::

Add notes to your Liveboards, so that viewers of your Liveboards can quickly understand how to use the data and visualizations you gathered. Note tiles can provide an overview of a Liveboard or visualization, definitions of terms used in the Liveboard, and so on. This feature must be enabled by your administrator. See xref:liveboard-note-tiles.adoc[Liveboard note tiles].

Upload custom geo maps::
Upload your own custom maps and visualize data on xref:chart-geo.adoc[geo charts] with regions that are specific to you and your organization.
+
For more information, see xref:geomaps-custom.adoc[].

Change filter order for Liveboard filters::

Arrange Liveboard filters in the filter bar so that they are in a logical, coherent order, by dragging and dropping them to different spots in the list. This makes it easier for viewers of the Liveboard to understand and use the filters on the Liveboard. For more information, see xref:liveboard-filters.adoc#order[Change the filter order].

TML for Monitor alerts::
TML for Monitor alerts is now GA and on by default. Export, edit, and import xref:monitor.adoc[KPI Monitor alerts] programmatically, using ThoughtSpot Modeling Language. For more information, see xref:tml.adoc#syntax-alerts[Syntax of the Monitor alert TML file].

Remove attached files from scheduled emails:: For data security, you may choose to remove attached files from scheduled Liveboard emails. When this feature is enabled, scheduled Liveboard email recipients will receive an email with a link to the Liveboard, which they will need to sign in to see.To ensure that only signed-in users can access your data, contact ThoughtSpot Support to enable this option. For more information, see xref:schedule-liveboards.adoc#disable-csv-pdf[Scheduled Liveboards].

Add a custom message in the alert notification:: When creating an alert for a KPI chart, you can now include a custom message in the alert update email. You can use this feature to specify next steps the alert subscribers should take once the KPI reaches a certain threshold.

Disable heatmap data labels::

Optionally disable heatmap charts' data labels, and understand the chart quickly by scanning the heatmap colors. This makes complex heatmap charts with many data values easier to read. See xref:chart-heatmap.adoc#labels[Heatmap charts].

Show timezone in scheduled Liveboards modal:: When scheduling Liveboards, you can now specify your timezone.

Search suggestions on columns with many values::
For any column with a high cardinality, which is defined as more than 100,000 unique column values, ThoughtSpot does not index the column if the index type is `DEFAULT`. This means the column values do not show up in search suggestions. Previously, this limit was 1 million unique column values. This change improves performance, and reduces index times and memory usage.
+
If you have existing columns with a cardinality between 100,000 and 1 million, and you use these columns' search suggestions regularly, ThoughtSpot will continue to index these columns.
+
For more information, see xref:data-modeling-index.adoc#high-cardinality[High cardinality and performance].

Parameter runtime overrides::

Adjust parameter values at runtime from Liveboard or Answer URLs, or using REST API v1 requests. For more information, see xref:parameters-use.adoc#runtime-overrides[Runtime overrides for parameters] and https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/?pageid=whats-new[What's new for developers^].

Scheduled or downloaded Liveboard PDF width::

By default, scheduled and downloaded Liveboard PDFs now render at a width of 1920 px. This ensures that most Liveboard PDFs you download or schedule look the same as the Liveboards you see in ThoughtSpot. You can also change this default width to a different width for your company, by contacting {support-url}. See xref:liveboard-download-pdf.adoc#pdf-width[Download a Liveboard as a PDF] and xref:liveboard-schedule.adoc#pdf-width[Schedule a Liveboard job].

Specify time zone when scheduling Liveboards::

When scheduling Liveboards, you can now specify your time zone. For more information, see xref:liveboard-schedule.adoc#frequency[Schedule a Liveboard job].


Group aggregate enhancements: filters:: Group aggregate filter enhancements are GA and on by default. Previously, when using group_aggregate formulas, users could use query_filters to include filters entered in the search bar in the formula's value, but it was difficult to write a formula that accepted filters from only a single column. +
Starting with this release, you can specify column names within the ‘filters’ section of a group_aggregate formula, and any filter in your search bar referencing that column will be added to the formula. Filters entered in the search bar that are not on columns specified in the third argument of the group_aggregate formula will be ignored. For details, see xref:formulas-aggregation-flexible.adoc#groupagg-filters-enhancement[Group aggregation filters].

Group aggregate enhancement: reaggregation [.badge.badge-beta-relnotes]#Beta#:: To reduce confusion when using aggregate formulas, the level of detail defined in group formulas is now respected at query level. For more information, see xref:formulas-aggregation-flexible.adoc#reaggregation-enhancement[Flexible aggregation functions].


Data labels on a dark background::
Data labels on a dark background are now GA and on by default. Labels that appear on a dark background now display in a lighter text color, making them easier to read.

Text keywords enhancements::

We improved the syntax of our text keywords, such as `begins with` and `contains`, to provide users with more flexibility. For example, the `contains` keyword now accepts expressions such as `product name contains 'shoes' or 'snickers'`. See the xref:keywords.adoc#text[Keyword reference].
+
Additionally, if your query includes two or more `contains` phrases that modify the same column, ThoughtSpot now combines the phrases using `or` logic, instead of `and`. If you have existing Answers or visualizations using this `and` logic, ThoughtSpot will automatically update your queries after you upgrade to 9.2.0.cl, to ensure they return the same information. See xref:keywords.adoc#contains[the contains keyword].

[#9-2-0-cl-business-user]
=== For the Business User

AI-generated answers:: You can now use natural language to search for answers to your business questions. To try it out, navigate to the Home page, select the search bar labeled *Ask any business question you have* and type your question. When you enter your question, you will see the AI generated answer appear, along with a list of related Answers created by users in your team.
+
You can select the Worksheet to search on by clicking the Worksheet title in the left side of the search bar and selecting a new Worksheet from the dropdown. Worksheets with AI answers enabled display a triangular icon to the left of the Worksheet name: image:icon-ai-answer.png[AI answer enabled icon].

Parameters at the Answer level::

Any user can now create parameters at the Answer level to optimize their data inquiries. Use parameters to run different scenarios with adjustable values, without creating or modifying the constants in formulas for each new value. See xref:parameters-create.adoc#answer[Creating Answer parameters] and xref:parameters-use.adoc[Using parameters].

Mandatory Liveboard filters::

Mandatory Liveboard filters are now GA. Mark certain filters in your Liveboard as mandatory. If you add mandatory filters to a Liveboard, the visualizations will only load after Liveboard viewers select values for the mandatory filters. Use mandatory filters for Liveboards that contain data that may not be relevant for everyone who must view and consume the Liveboard. Mandatory filters also lower query and performance costs.
+
For more information, see xref:liveboard-filters-mandatory.adoc[].

Custom comparison points for KPI charts:: You can now set your KPI chart to display a percent change comparison between the most recent data point and a custom comparison point. For example, when searching for `sales monthly`, you can choose to see percent change between this month and the previous month, previous quarter, or previous year. For more information, see
xref:chart-kpi.adoc#kpi-custom-comparison[Custom comparison points].

Change analysis for KPI charts::
KPI change analysis is now GA and on by default. You can now use change analysis to directly identify the key drivers for change in your KPIs. +
To access this feature, go to your KPI chart and select the caret icon to the right of the percent change label. The *Run change analysis* pop-up allows you to customize the attribute columns ThoughtSpot analyzes. ThoughtSpot runs change analysis for the most recent data point and the past comparison data point as per the KPI chart's configuration. Note that you need SpotIQ privileges to use the KPI change analysis feature.

Anomaly detection for time-series KPI charts [.badge.badge-beta-relnotes]#Beta#:: You can now see anomalies in time-series KPI charts. Our new anomaly detection algorithm detects data which does not fall within the expected confidence intervals, while allowing for seasonal changes and growth over time. To try it out, open your KPI chart as an Answer, open the chart configuration menu, and select *Show anomalies*. See xref:time-series-anomalies.adoc[].

Parameters::
The parameters feature is now GA and on by default. Create Worksheet parameters to optimize your data inquiries. Use parameters to run different scenarios with adjustable values, without creating or modifying the constants in formulas for each new value. For more information, refer to xref:parameters-create.adoc[] and xref:parameters-use.adoc[].

ThoughtSpot Sync::
You can now use ThoughtSpot Sync to sync data directly from an Answer or custom SQL view to the following apps: +
+
--
* xref:sync-gainsight.adoc[Gainsight]
* xref:sync-zoho.adoc[Zoho]
--
+
Using ThoughtSpot Sync, you can push insights directly to your selected app, notify your teams, and view data in context. ThoughtSpot Sync automatically establishes a secure pipeline to the destination app and thus eliminates the need for building custom connectors.

Schedule ThoughtSpot Sync:: When scheduling a sync with an external app, you can now choose to schedule every 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 45 minutes, in addition to the other existing schedule options.

Create a sync as an admin:: When creating a sync to an external app, admin users will no longer see destinations created by other users in the *Destinations* dropdown menu. Admin users will still be able to see a list of all destinations created by users in their organization when they navigate to the *Destinations* tab in the Data Workspace.

HubSpot Sync mapping fields:: When creating a sync to HubSpot, you can now use email as a mapping field on the Contacts object type, as well as ContactID.

Apply multiple changes to charts at once:: In previous releases, every time a user reordered the fields in the chart configuration panel, the chart reloaded. When creating a visualization with multiple fields, users often need to make multiple rearrangements to reach a desired chart. Now users can make multiple configurations and apply them at the same time rather than waiting in between each configuration. For more information, see
xref:chart-x-axis.adoc[Reorder labels on the axis or legend].

Specify format when downloading charts and tables::

We streamlined the file format options when downloading tables and charts from ThoughtSpot. You can download tables in XLSX, CSV, or PDF format, and download charts in XLSX, CSV, or PNG format. To try it out, open a chart or table, and select *Download* from the *more options* menu image:icon-more-10px.png[ellipsis icon]. For more information, see
xref:search-download.adoc#download-chart-table[Download a chart or table].


Mobile app Load More button:: When using ThoughtSpot Mobile, you can now press the *Load More* button at the bottom of a table to see the next 100 rows of data.

Improvements to French keywords::
This release improves the translated French keywords. See xref:keywords-fr-FR.adoc[].

Notification preferences::
In your user profile, you can now set the option of receiving email notifications when other users share Liveboards or answers with you, or when they request access to Liveboards or answers which you edit. See xref:search-data.adoc#notification-prefs[Notification preferences].

[#9-2-0-cl-data-engineer]
=== For the Data Engineer

SQL Server connection:: You can now create connections from ThoughtSpot to SQL Server. For details, see xref:connections-sql-server.adoc[SQL Server].

Generic JDBC connection:: You can now create connections from ThoughtSpot to Generic JDBC databases. For details, see xref:connections-jdbc.adoc[Generic JDBC].

Certify Amazon Aurora and Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) for PostgreSQL:: You can now connect to and query Amazon Aurora and Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL databases.

Databricks Catalog field:: When creating a connection to Databricks, you can now enter your catalog name under the *Catalog* field. For more information, see xref:connections-databricks-add.adoc[Add a Databricks connection].

Sync destinations for admin users:: Beginning in 9.2.0.cl, admin users will not see destinations created by other users in the Destinations drop-down that appears when setting up a sync. Admin users will still be able to view all destinations on the Sync page in the Data workspace.

Delete table columns using TML::

Remove columns from tables in ThoughtSpot by deleting them in the tables' TML files. We support deleting a column from a TML file and removing that column's dependencies in the same zip file import. Note that if the deletion of a column fails, the whole import will fail. For more information, see xref:scriptability.adoc#delete[Deleting columns, joins, and RLS rules].

Edit join conditions using TML::

Use TML to directly edit a join condition by editing the TML file's `on` parameter. This replaces the existing process of deleting and recreating the join in TML or the ThoughtSpot application. For more information, see xref:tml.adoc#syntax-joins[TML join syntax].

Join creation for views [.badge.badge-beta-relnotes]#Beta#::
We standardized the method of creating joins for all data objects in ThoughtSpot. When creating a join from a view, users are now directed to a *Create join* page where they can choose a connection, name the join, and map the source and destination columns.

[#9-2-0-cl-it-ops-engineer]
=== For the IT/Ops Engineer

Cross-Region Disaster Recovery::

Cross-Region Disaster Recovery allows ThoughtSpot to recover your ThoughtSpot instance in a secondary cloud region in the case of a failure of the primary cloud region where ThoughtSpot is running. This ensures that if one cloud region fails, ThoughtSpot can start in another region, guaranteeing minimal downtime. See xref:business-continuity.adoc#disaster-recovery[Data Protection and Disaster Recovery].

Object Usage Liveboard:: Use the Object Usage Liveboard to easily track how specific objects (Liveboards, Answers, Worksheets, or tables) are trending over time. Our new visualizations allow you to understand adoption on the object-level, and filter on a specific user or users to see usage on the user-level. For more information, see xref:object-usage-liveboard.adoc[Object Usage Liveboard].
