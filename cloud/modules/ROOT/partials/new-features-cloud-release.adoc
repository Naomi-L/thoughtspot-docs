Sage Coach enhancements::
Filters improvement:::
Filters for Worksheets, feedback providers, and editors have been refined to display only relevant values when managing feedback. For example, only Worksheets with existing feedback entries will appear in the filter options, rather than showing all Worksheets in the system.
This enhancement improves the filtering process, making it more efficient and user-friendly.
