[#9-3-0-cl-first]
=== For the First User

Getting started with ThoughtSpot Cloud::
The first user on the account has to complete a series of steps before other people can start using ThoughtSpot with your organization's data.
For these instructions, see xref:ts-cloud-getting-started.adoc[Getting Started with ThoughtSpot Cloud].

[#9-3-0-cl-analyst]
=== For the Analyst

Liveboard note tiles::

The Liveboard note tiles feature is now GA. Add notes to your Liveboards, so that viewers of your Liveboards can quickly understand how to use the data and visualizations you gathered. Note tiles can provide an overview of a Liveboard or visualization, company branding through images, definitions of terms used in the Liveboard, and so on. With the GA of the note tiles feature, you don't need a specific privilege to upload images. See xref:liveboard-notes.adoc[Liveboard note tiles].

Change filter order for Answer filters::

Arrange Answer filters in the filter bar so that they are in a logical, coherent order, by dragging and dropping them to different spots in the list. This makes it easier for viewers of the Answer to understand and use the filters on the Answer. For more information, see xref:filters.adoc#order[Change the filter order].

Group aggregate enhancement: reaggregation:: To reduce confusion when using aggregate formulas, the level of detail defined in group formulas is now respected at query level. For example, when trying to calculate the contribution of each store’s sales to the entire region, you might use a group_sum formula, where the sales at store level is divided by the sales at regional level. Your search would include the following columns: `Revenue`, `Customer nation`, `Regional Revenue formula`, and `Customer region`, where `Regional Revenue formula =  group_sum(Revenue, Customer Region)`.
+
According to the old reaggregation behavior, if a customer removed `Customer region` from the search bar, the level of detail in the formula would no longer be respected and the formula’s denominator would re-aggregate up to the total. In this case, the formula result would display revenue as a percentage of total revenue, rather than as a percentage of regional revenue.
+
Under the new aggregation behavior, the formula result will continue to display revenue as a percentage of each region, even if you remove `Customer region` from the search bar. Visualizations will also display the correct aggregation even if the grouping column is not added to the X-axis.

xref:formulas-aggregation-flexible.adoc#reaggregation-enhancement[Flexible aggregation functions].

=== For the Business User

Liveboard cross filters::

Liveboard cross filters are now GA. Click on any data point in your Liveboard and easily filter the entire Liveboard by that value. For example, if you select *California* in a geo chart on your Liveboard, and then select *Filter*, all the other visualizations only show data from California. A visualization for *Total sales by city*, for example, would only show sales for cities in California. This feature is also called _brushing and linking_. For more information, see
xref:liveboard-filters-cross.adoc[Liveboard cross filters].

Access the contextual menu on left click::

Accessing the contextual menu for visualization data points on left-click is now GA. Instead of right-clicking on a data point to include or exclude it, drill down on it, or show underlying data, now you can access the menu more easily, with a single left-click.


Attributes in pivot table cells:: You can now include attributes in the pivot table cells as well as measures. This is useful for cases when you want to summarize text data such as user role, pass/fail, or other attributes. For more information, see
xref:chart-pivot-table.adoc#attributes[Pivot table charts].

Liveboard header visible when you scroll down::
When you scroll down in a Liveboard, the Liveboard name, menu options, and filter and tab bars remain visible. You don't need to scroll back up to the top to edit the Liveboard or check if you're filtering by a specific store. You can see the filters or parameters applied to the Liveboard, select the *Edit* button or more options image:icon-more-10px.png[more options menu icon] menu, and view which tab you're on from any spot in the Liveboard.
