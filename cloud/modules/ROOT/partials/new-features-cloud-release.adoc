Threshold-based alerts for KPI charts [.badge.badge-update]#Beta#::
You can now use the Monitor feature to receive alerts when your KPI satisfies a given threshold condition. For example, create a condition to receive an alert when your Sales KPI becomes `greater than 200,000`, or when your KPI for Sales weekly `increases by 2%`. For more information, see xref:monitor.adoc#threshold-based-alert[Create a threshold-based alert].

By default, the *Make content discoverable* checkbox that appears when you save or share an answer grants view access to any teammate with access to the answerâ€™s underlying worksheet.
