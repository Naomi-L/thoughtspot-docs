[#9-1-0-cl-first]
=== For the First User

Getting started with ThoughtSpot Cloud::
The first user on the account has to complete a series of steps before other people can start using ThoughtSpot with your organization's data.
For these instructions, see xref:ts-cloud-getting-started.adoc[Getting Started with ThoughtSpot Cloud].

[#9-1-0-cl-analyst]
=== For the Analyst

Upload custom geo maps::
Upload your own custom maps and visualize data on xref:chart-geo.adoc[geo charts] with regions that are specific to you and your organization.
+
For more information, see xref:geomaps-custom.adoc[].

Change filter order for Liveboard filters::

Arrange Liveboard filters in the filter bar so that they are in a logical, coherent order, by dragging and dropping them to different spots in the list. This makes it easier for viewers of the Liveboard to understand and use the filters on the Liveboard. For more information, see xref:liveboard-filters.adoc#order[Change the filter order].

[#9-1-0-cl-business-user]
=== For the Business User

Mandatory Liveboard filters::

Mandatory Liveboard filters are now GA. Mark certain filters in your Liveboard as mandatory. If you add mandatory filters to a Liveboard, the visualizations will only load after Liveboard viewers select values for the mandatory filters. Use mandatory filters for Liveboards that contain data that may not be relevant for everyone who must view and consume the Liveboard. Mandatory filters also lower query and performance costs.
+
For more information, see xref:liveboard-filters-mandatory.adoc[].

Explain change for KPI charts::
KPI explain change is now GA and on by default. You can now use SpotIQ analysis to directly identify the key drivers for recent change in your KPIs. KPI change analysis allows you to drill down into the causes of change in your KPIs and customize the insights generated by SpotIQ. +
To access this feature, go to your KPI chart and select the caret icon to the right of the percent change label. The *Run change analysis* pop-up allows you to customize the columns ThoughtSpot analyzes. Note that ThoughtSpot runs change analysis between the two most recent data points defined by the KPIâ€™s time bucket (for example, `daily` or `weekly`).

Custom comparison points for KPI charts:: You can now set your KPI chart to display a percent change comparison between the most recent data point and a custom comparison point. For example, when searching for `sales monthly`, you can choose to see percent change between this month and the previous month, previous quarter, or previous year. For more information, see
xref:chart-kpi.adoc#kpi-custom-comparison[Custom comparison points].

Parameters::
The parameters feature is now GA and on by default. Create Worksheet parameters to optimize your data inquiries. Use parameters to run different scenarios with adjustable values, without creating or modifying the constants in formulas for each new value. For more information, refer to xref:parameters-create.adoc[] and xref:parameters-use.adoc[].

[#9-1-0-cl-data-engineer]
=== For the Data Engineer


SQL Server connection:: You can now create connections from ThoughtSpot to SQL Server. For details, see xref:connections-sql-server.adoc[SQL Server].

Delete table columns using TML::

Remove columns from tables in ThoughtSpot by deleting them in the tables' TML files. For more information, see xref:tml.adoc#syntax-tables[Syntax of the table TML file].
