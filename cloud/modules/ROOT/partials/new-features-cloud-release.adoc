[#9-0-0-cl-first]
=== For the First User

Getting started with ThoughtSpot Cloud::
The first user on the account has to complete a series of steps before other people can start using ThoughtSpot with your organization's data.
For these instructions, see xref:ts-cloud-getting-started.adoc[Getting Started with ThoughtSpot Cloud].

[#9-0-0-cl-analyst]
=== For the Analyst

Delete joins and RLS rules through TML::
When you edit and import TML files, ThoughtSpot now supports deletion of joins and RLS rules. Refer to xref:tml.adoc[].

Export FQNs when exporting TML files::

To reduce ambiguity when exporting TML files, export the fully qualified names (FQNs) for the objects' data sources. If you select this option, the TML file contains FQNs for the underlying tables and connections.

For more information, see xref:tml.adoc#fqn[ThoughtSpot Modeling Language].

Upload custom geo maps::

Upload your own custom maps and visualize data on xref:chart-geo.adoc[geo charts] with regions that are specific to you and your organization. This feature must be enabled by your administrator.
+

[#9-0-0-cl-business-user]
=== For the Business User

Mandatory Liveboard filters::

Mark certain filters in your Liveboard as mandatory. If you add mandatory filters to a Liveboard, the visualizations will only load after Liveboard viewers select values for the mandatory filters. Use mandatory filters for Liveboards that contain data that may not be relevant for everyone who must view and consume the Liveboard. Mandatory filters also lower query and performance costs. This feature must be enabled by your administrator.
+
For more information about mandatory filters, see xref:liveboard-filters-mandatory.adoc[].

ThoughtSpot Sync ServiceNow connection [.label.label-dep]#Deprecated#:: You can now sync data directly from an Answer or custom SQL view to ServiceNow. Using ThoughtSpot Sync, you can push insights directly to ServiceNow, notify your teams, and view data in context. ThoughtSpot Sync automatically establishes a secure pipeline to the destination app and thus eliminates the need for building custom connectors.

ThoughtSpot Sync HubSpot connection::
You can now sync data directly from an Answer or custom SQL view to Hubspot. Using ThoughtSpot Sync, you can push insights directly to Hubspot, notify your teams, and view data in context. ThoughtSpot Sync automatically establishes a secure pipeline to the destination app and thus eliminates the need for building custom connectors. +
For more information, see xref:sync-hubspot.adoc[].

Change the name or description of a Liveboard or visualization without entering *Edit* mode. The more image:icon-more-10px.png[more menu icon] menu for Liveboards and Liveboard visualizations now includes a *Rename* option, where you can also edit the object description.

Once your administrator enables this feature, go to *Data* > *Utilities*, and click *Upload CSV*.
