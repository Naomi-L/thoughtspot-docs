We know, you're itching to get to the analysis.
To help you and your team get started with {brand} as quickly as possible, we've put together this checklist of first steps.

=== Create a Workspace

xref:organizations.adoc[Workspaces] are groups of {brand} users that can securely share database connections and analysis with each other.
You must create a Workspace to xref:connecting-mode-to-your-database.adoc[connect your own database] to {brand}.

When you link:https://app.mode.com/signup?src=help_site[create your user account], {brand} will help you create a Workspace.
If you skipped this step when you created your account and now want to go back and create a Workspace, link:https://app.mode.com/organizations/new[start here].
Once you have created a Workspace you can xref:organizations.adoc#invite-a-new-member[send anyone an invitation to join it] so you can collaborate with them.

=== Connect a database

After creating a Workspace, you can xref:connecting-mode-to-your-database.adoc[connect one or more databases].
{brand} can connect to link:https://mode.com/data-sources/[most popular SQL databases].
Once you connect your data source, everyone in your Workspace can execute queries against it by default.

=== Invite collaborators

The easiest way to share reports, code, and database query access with others is to invite them to your {brand} Workspace.
To send an invite, start from the link:https://app.mode.com/home/[{brand} home page] for your Workspace, click on your name in the upper left corner, and then click *Invite to {brand}*.

=== Create analysis

The typical workflow for creating analysis in {brand} mirrors the typical workflow of an analyst:

=== Query data

When creating an analysis, the first step is gathering and structuring all necessary data from one or more databases using SQL.
To do this, you'll need to write and execute SQL code against one or more xref:connecting-mode-to-your-database.adoc[connected databases].
In {brand}, this is done within a xref:organizing-reports.adoc[report].

To create a new report, click the *new report* image:modal-add.svg[modal add] button in the upper right hand corner of the link:https://app.mode.com/home/[{brand} home page], which will take you the Query Editor, where you can compose SQL code.

=== Visualize results

Once you've written a query or two and have some data to play with, click xref:report-layout-and-presentation.adoc#report-builder[Report Builder] in the left panel to begin curating components--data tables, charts, or Notebook output cells--in a shareable report.
Design the report layout however you like: pick the charts and tables you want to show, rearrange their order, and specify each element's size.

You can also click *</>* at the top of the Report Builder to modify the code behind the individual elements in your report or build something completely custom using CSS, HTML, JavaScript, D3, and much more.

=== Share your work

xref:report-scheduling-and-sharing.adoc#sharing-and-scheduling[Share] your analysis with others.
{brand} makes it easy to share your work with other members of your Workspace, whether via email, Slack, or sending a URL.

When you share a report, viewers will be able to see the output of your work, including any visualizations, data tables, or code that went into creating it.
