=== Overview

Workspaces are groups of {brand} users that can securely share database connections and analyses with each other.
You may be a member of any number of Workspaces.
By default, any member of a Workspace can query any of the Workspace's private link:https://mode.com/data-sources/[database connections].

Anyone with a {brand} user account can link:https://app.mode.com/organizations/new[create a Workspace] for free.

=== Managing membership

[#roles-and-permissions]
==== Roles and permissions

You can see all the current and former members of your Workspace, as well as their current role, from the Members page in Workspace Settings:

. Navigate to the link:https://app.mode.com/home/[{brand} home page] and click on your name in the upper left corner of the window.
. Click *Workspace Settings*
. In the People section, click *Members*

All Workspace members will be listed on the right, grouped into tabs according to their role:

* *Admins* - Can remove members from the Workspace and grant Admin access to Full Members. +
They can create new database connections and query and manage settings for all database connections. Only admins can change many Workspace settings, including those related to member authentication. We recommend larger Workspaces have several admins.
* *Full Members* - Can create, view, and edit reports. +
Full members may create new database connections. They have query access to all of the Workspace's database connections that are not limited and any limited database connections which they have been granted access to by an admin or that connection's creator. By default, new members join as full members. By default, members join as full members.
* *Pending Members* - They have been invited to join the Workspace and their acceptance is pending.
* *Former Members* - Have been removed from the Workspace by an admin. +
These users no longer have access and cannot rejoin unless an admin re-invites them.

. On this tab, you will see a number of options to help you control how new members can join your Workspace:

image::Member-Authorization-settings.png[Member Authorization Settings]

[discrete]
====== Who can invite new members?

* *All Members*: (Default) Any existing member can invite new users to the Workspace.
* *Only Admins*: Only admins can invite new users to the Workspace.

[discrete]
====== What should happen when someone with your domain email address signs up for {brand}?

This setting will only be visible if your Workspace has <<claimed-domains,claimed a domain>>.

* *Approve Automatically*: (Default) Any new user with a verified email address in the indicated <<claimed-domains,claimed domain>> will automatically become a member of the Workspace when they sign up for {brand}.
* *Require Approval*: An admin must approve each new member after they are invited to join the Workspace.

[#claimed-domains]
==== Claimed domains

{brand} customers have the option to "claim" their corporate email address domains.
Any users who sign up for {brand} subsequent to the domain being claimed, with a verified email address in the claimed domain, will be automatically added to the Workspace that claimed the domain.
Once a Workspace claims a domain, no subsequent Workspace can claim the same domain.

This is designed to create a streamlined onboarding process for new {brand} users who work at the same company by ensuring that new users are added to the company's existing {brand} workspace.

===== Requirements

To claim a domain, the following requirement must be met:

* The {brand} Workspace must be on a link:https://mode.com/compare-plans/[paid plan].

====== How claimed domains work

For this example we'll use a fictitious company called Octan Industries.
All employees at Octan Industries have an email address ending in @octan.com.

Ann works for Octan industries and has the email address ann@octan.com.
She verifies her email address and creates a new {brand} Workspace.
Ann elects to purchase a link:https://mode.com/compare-plans/[paid {brand} plan] on behalf of her company.
Ann wants to ensure that every Octan industries user who signs up for a {brand} account on their own ends up in the workspace she is managing, instead of creating their own free workspace.
Therefore Ann reaches out to {brand}'s support team to claim the @octan.com domain.

Later, when bill@octan.com signs up for {brand} and verifies his email address, he will be automatically added to the Octan Workspace and can collaborate with Ann in {brand}.

When SSO is enabled, users will be able to sign up with their email and will immediately have access to the Workspace if they are already logged into the SSO provider (that is, Google).
This is a very seamless experience for users to access {brand}. xref:contact-us.adoc[Contact our support team] to claim a domain.

IMPORTANT: Some domains are not available to be claimed. For example, they may belong to a large institution and require additional authorization, or they may be shared email domains used by many Workspaces. In such cases, we encourage customers to use email invites or a third-party identity provider to set up user accounts in {brand}.

'''

=== User account

==== Update your profile

Your user profile allows you to customize your {brand} experience across all of the {brand} Workspaces where you are a member.
To update your profile, start by navigating to the link:https://app.mode.com/home/[{brand} home page] and signing in if you aren't already:

. Click on your name in the upper left corner of the window and click *My Account*.
. Click on *Profile* under Account Settings.

Here you'll find a number of tabs containing settings for your profile that will be common across for your experience throughout {brand}:

* *Details* - Adjust your name, query editor theme, and time zone.
* *Email* - Update your email address. _(Note: Remember to verify your email address after updating it.)_
* *Password* - Update your {brand} password.
* *Avatar* - Change the avatar associated with your user account.
If you have a link:https://en.gravatar.com/[Gravatar] account, you can link it on this page to use your Gravatar as your {brand} avatar.

==== Verify your email address

You can access much of {brand}'s public functionality without verifying your email address.
However, if you'd like to join Workspaces and access private data, you will need to verify your email address.

When you create an account or update your email address, {brand} automatically sends you an email asking you to confirm your email address.
To verify your email, simply click the link in that email.

==== Delete your account

Deleting your account will delete any reports you created against the {brand} Public Warehouse and delete any data you uploaded to the {brand} Public Warehouse.
Reports created inside of any other Workspace will not be deleted--other members inside that Workspace will still have access to those reports.

. From the {brand} homepage, click on your account dropdown menu in the upper left.
. Click *Account*.
. Click on *Profile* under Account Settings.
. Click *Delete account...* in the lower right corner.
. Type your username in the text box and click *Permanently Delete Account*.

==== Leave a Workspace

If you are the only admin of a Workspace, you cannot leave the Workspace until you <<change-the-role-of-a-member,make another member an admin>>.

. Navigate to your link:https://app.mode.com/home/[{brand} homepage]
. Click on your name in the upper left corner.
. Click *Workspace Settings* from the dropdown menu.
. Click the *Details* tab under the Workspace header on the left side.
. Click the leave button *Leave* under Actions.
. Confirm you want to leave this Workspace by clicking the *Leave* button again.

===== What happens when you leave a {brand} Workspace

Leaving a Workspace does not delete your {brand} account, even if you leave all Workspaces in which you are a member.
When you leave a Workspace:

* Any assets (for example, reports, code, etc.) created by you inside the {brand} Workspace are retained and will remain accessible by the remaining users in the Workspace.
These assets will continue to show your name as the owner.
* Any report in your xref:spaces.adoc#types-of-spaces[personal Collection] will remain in your personal Collection and remain accessible by any member of the Workspace in possession of the report URL.
* An admin of the Workspace can invite you back to the Workspace at any time.

==== Personal API tokens

We recommend using Workspace API tokens rather than personal ones.
You can continue to use existing personal API tokens with the API.
However, you will not be able to generate new personal tokens.
If you need a new access token for the API, an Admin in your workspace can generate one for you.
xref:workspace-api-tokens.adoc[See here for more information on Workspace API tokens].

When using personal API tokens, access to resources in the API directly matches your level of permissions in the {brand} Workspace you're calling.
Before returning a response, {brand} validates every API call against your permissions in that Workspace.

=== Privacy and security

==== Report visibility

Everyone on the internet can access your {brand} Workspace's public profile page (for example, https://app.mode.com/modeanalytics) as well as the reports in your Workspace's xref:spaces.adoc#community-space[community Collection].
In addition, all {brand} users can access any data uploaded by members of your Workspace to xref:managing-database-connections.adoc#mode-public-warehouse[{brand}'s Public Warehouse].

Any other report in your Workspace, including its code and query results, is *only* visible to other members of your {brand} Workspace unless someone has explicitly enabled external sharing for that report.

==== GDPR

{brand} is committed to meeting the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR').
The GDPR is a landmark EU data privacy law, effective May 2018, which affects both European and non-European businesses.
link:https://mode.com/gdpr/[Learn more about {brand}'s GDPR readiness, security infrastructure, and subprocessors].

{brand} offers a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) and EU Model Contract Clauses as a means of meeting the adequacy and security requirements of the European Parliament and Council of the European Union's Data Protection Directive and the GDPR.
{brand}'s DPA is available to all Workspaces using {brand} and is automatically incorporated in the Terms of Service.
The DPA can be found link:https://mode.com/legal/dpa/[here].

[#managing-schedules]
=== Managing Schedules

Workspace Admins can edit individual and delete multiple report schedules from the Schedules page.
Admins will be able to see all report schedules for their organization/workspace.

image::workspace_settings_schedules_2.gif[managing schedules 2]

Filters can be applied to locate schedules based on schedule attributes such as frequency, delivery method, and the presence of subscribers.

image::workspace_settings_schedules_1.gif[managing schedules 1]

=== Custom calendar

The custom calendar settings can be found in the default settings tab within workspace settings.
Administrators have the ability to modify the year and week start preferences for their workspace.
Any changes made to the year or week start will automatically update all existing charts and Reports within the workspace, as well as affect new charts and Reports, unless these preferences have been specifically defined at the chart level.
The default system settings are January for the beginning of the year and Sunday for the start of the week.

==== Flexible seat and monthly data compute rates

While all paid {brand} plans are on an annual term, you have the flexibility to scale up and down seats and monthly compute data outside of your annual plan at a "flex rate".

==== Seat flex rates

For any users beyond the number of included users in your {brand} agreement, you will be charged a pro-rated amount for each user based on the number of days in the billing period (typically monthly) that the user was a member of your Workspace.

As an example, let's assume the flex rate for adding an additional member to your Workspace is $27/month.
Let's say you add a coworker to your Workspace 10 days into your monthly billing period and there are 20 remaining days in that month.
Since the coworker was a member of your Workspace for 2/3 of the billing period, you will be billed 2/3 of $27 ($18) for their seat for the period.
If you remove another team member the same day, you would be billed for 1/3 of $27 ($9) for that member's seat during the period.

You can add additional seats to your annual agreement at the annual price at any time by contacting your CSM or link:mailto:customersuccess@mode.com[customersuccess@mode.com].

==== Data compute flex rates

For any data compute used beyond the monthly limit included in your {brand} agreement, you will be charged for the total GB used over your limit pro-rated to the "flex rate" based on your current {brand} plan.
Data compute for your {brand} Workspace is calculated monthly by adding the GB from the total cumulative queries pulled into {brand}'s Helix Data Engine for the month.

Your {brand} plan includes a monthly data compute limit, and all flex data fees are calculated monthly and billed quarterly.

As an example, let's assume the flex rate for your {brand} plan is $1250 per 100GB.
In month 1, you use 105GB of cumulative data compute.
In month 2, you use 95GB of cumulative data compute.
In month 3, you use 120GB of cumulative data compute.
Your overall bill would be ((105 - 100)/100 * 1250) + ((120-100)/100 * 1250) = 62.5 + 250 = 312.50.

You can add additional monthly data compute throughput to your annual agreement at the annual price at any time by contacting your CSM or link:mailto:customersuccess@mode.com[customersuccess@mode.com].

[#faqs]
=== FAQs

[discrete]
====== *Q: If a user is deactivated, can we retrieve the reports in their personal collection?*

Yes.
Since {brand} reports are owned by workspaces rather than individuals, all of the reports the user created should remain unchanged after they leave the workspace.
Reports living in personal collections can still be accessed by workspace admins if they have the report URLs.

Workspace admins can move reports from a user's personal collection into a public or private collection of their choice using the link:https://mode.com/developer/api-cookbook/management/move-report/[{brand} API].
Please note that the report tokens are required for this automation.
If you need a list of the report tokens in the deactivated user's personal collection, please have a workspace admin contact Support.

[discrete]
====== *Q: What are the potential impacts when a user is deactivated?*

Please note that if a user is deactivated, the following may experience technical issues:

*White-Label Embeds:*  Any White-Label Embed created by the user will experience technical issues.
In order to resolve this issue, you can create a duplicate of the report and use the URL for the duplicated report as the embed URL instead, as you are the creator of the duplicated report.
For further assistance, please refer to error #4 in our xref:white-label-embeds.adoc#troubleshooting[troubleshooting guide].

*Managing Private and Personal Collection Reports:* Please be aware that since {brand} reports are owned by workspaces rather than individuals, all reports created by the user should remain unchanged after they leave the workspace.
Reports located in personal collections can still be accessed by workspace admins if they have the report URLs.
If the reports are in a public collection, they will still be accessible to the workspace as usual.
However, if the reports are in a private collection and the user is the only member of this collection, they will not be viewable or movable due to current limitations on permissions.

[discrete]
====== *Q: How to cancel an invite sent out by an admin?*

As an admin, you have the ability to cancel an invite by following these steps:

. On your homepage, navigate to your workspace setting by clicking on the dropdown next to your name, and then *Workspace Settings*.
. Click on the *Members* tab on the left side navigator.
. Ensure you have selected the *Pending members* category in the dropdown.
. Click on the vertical dots on the right side after the *Managed By* column for that specific user.
. Click on *Cancel Invite*.

[discrete]
====== *Q: Users signed up for {brand} but didn't get email confirmation to join workspace*

This behavior is seen when the workspace has "admin-invite only" enabled and/or the admin has not approved the request to join the workspace.
In many cases, when users click "Continue" in their email to verify their email address, nothing else is sent to them.
We recommend reaching out to the admin for next steps.
If you are unsure who the admin users are in your workspace, or need confirmation that this is the case, you can contact support via Live Chat or email us at link:mailto:support@mode.com[support@mode.com].

This can also happen if you sign up using SAML and the workspace has "admin-invite only" enabled.
If anyone is allowed to join the workspace using their SAML login, an Admin should disable this feature.
