== Overview

A Collection is a place for {brand} users to organize reports and Datasets around a team, project, or common theme.
All {brand} reports and Datasets live in exactly one Collection, but a report or Dataset can be easily xref:organizing-reports.adoc#move-a-report-to-another-collection[moved] to a different Collection within the same {brand} Workspace.

Collections that you belong to are listed on the left side of your link:https://app.mode.com/home/[{brand} home page] under the *Collections* section.
Click on a Collection to see a list of all of the reports and Datasets in that Collection.
At the top of your screen, you can toggle to get different views of the available content in the Collection.
You can also sort reports and Datasets by name or by when they were last edited.
The availability of different types of Collections depends on your {brand} Workspace's version:

{brand} Studio Workspaces have one Collection that is created when the Workspace is created and cannot be deleted.

Workspaces with a paid {brand} plan can have an unlimited number of Collections, and anyone in the Workspace can create any number of Collections.
Users can see all Collections they have access to in the Collections list when they click on *Collections* in their navigation panel.

[#types-of-spaces]
== Types of Collections

[#personal-space]
=== Personal content

You have a personal Collection in each {brand} Workspace in which you are a member.
Your personal Collection is created for you when you join a Workspace, and it cannot be renamed or deleted.

When you create a new report, it will live your personal Collection until you xref:organizing-reports.adoc#move-a-report-to-another-collection[move it] to another Collection.
Manage access to your Personal content by navigating to *Personal* in the navigation, clicking the gear button, and selecting *Manage Access*.

_(Recommended)_ Keep the default access set to *Viewer* if you want users in your Workspace to be able to view Personal content you share with them.
Note that other users cannot navigate to or search for your Personal content.
They can only view the Report if you share the link with them.

Update the default access to *Restricted* if you don't want users in your Workspace to view or edit your Personal content.

You can also specifically grant individuals and groups access to view and edit Personal content you share with them.

[#community-space]
=== Community Collection

Reports in the community Collection are public and can be viewed, shared, run, or duplicated by anyone on the internet.
Building reports based on data in the xref:managing-database-connections.adoc#mode-public-warehouse[{brand} Public Warehouse] and saving them in the community Collection is a great way to demonstrate and share your analytics and visualization skills with the entire {brand} community and beyond.

Each Workspace's community Collection is hidden by default, but it can be easily xref:sharing-and-embedding.adoc#sharing[enabled] by a Workspace admin.
When enabled, every member of the Workspace can contribute to the community Collection, and they will see it listed on the left side of their home page in the Collections section.

The community Collection can only include reports with queries that run against the {brand} Public Warehouse.
If a report has ever queried a database other than the {brand} Public Warehouse, such as any of your Workspace's private connected databases, the report can no longer be moved into the community Collection.
This is true even if the most recent run of the report only queries the {brand} Public Warehouse.

All Collections you have access to and have been added to your navigation will be listed in the Collections section on the left side of your {brand} home page.
Any new Collections you've been added to will also show up in your navigation automatically.
If you do not want the Collection to show up in the Collections section, you may go to the Collection and remove it from your navigation.

If you want to add a Collection to your navigation, go to "My Collections," select the Collection you wish to add, and click the icon next to the Collection name.

TIP: Adding Members and Groups to a Collection will automatically add that Collection to the recently-added users' side-navigation. To ensure that new Workspace Members see relevant Collections, add the new Members to Groups with access to the Collections, and they will see their side-navigation populated with the relevant Collections.

[#faqs]
== FAQs

[discrete]
=== *Q: Are restricted collections synced to GitHub?*

Both restricted and public collections are synced to GitHub.
Reports in users' personal Collections or the community Collection will not be synced.

[discrete]
=== *Q: How do Collection and Connection permissions determine Report access for users?*

Users must both have permission for the Connections used in a Report and the Collection that contains a Report in order to access the Report.
For example, if a user has view permission for all Connections used in a Report but is not a member of the private Collection containing the Report, they will be unable to view the Report.
They must have access to both.
