[#name-and-description]
== Name and description

After a report has been successfully run at least once, you can change its name and description:

. From the report editor, click *Report* in the header and then click *Rename*.
. Enter a name and, optionally, a description.
. Click *Save*.

You can remove the report's name and/or description from the report layout using the <<html-editor,HTML editor>>.

TIP: You can refer to the Report's name and description in the HTML editor using the `{{ title }}` and `{{ description }}` template code. These templates will render to the Report's name and description values when the Report is viewed.

[#colors-and-themes]
== Report themes

Your Workspace includes a number of built-in themes which you may be able to complement with custom themes.
Themes can be applied to a Report in <<settings,Report Settings>>.
In addition, you may style any Report by <<html-editor,including custom CSS using the HTML editor>>.

*Add a new custom theme*

** *Set as default*: Admins only.
Set this palette as the default for all new reports.
Does not impact any existing reports.
** *Delete*: Delete the palette.

[#report-details]
== Report details

Open a Report and click *View Details* in the header to see additional details about the Report, including the logic and data behind it.
Along the left side, you may see some or all of the following sections, depending on your level of access to the report:

* *Details:* Includes the names of any collaborators (users who have modified the Report) and the Report's <<run-history,run history>>.
* *HTML:* The HTML code that defines the <<layout-grid,Report layout>> as well as any embedded custom HTML, JavaScript, or CSS.
* *Notebook:* Any input, output, and markup cells (including Python or R code) if defined in the Report's xref:notebook.adoc[Notebook].
* *SQL* and *Results*: The SQL code and results for each query in the report.
+
TIP: Don't see **View Details** in the Report header? You may be in the Report editor. If so, click **View** in the header first.

[#run-history]
=== Run history

Every time you run a Report, {product} saves a copy of its configuration and results (excluding Notebook code, HTML, chart configuration, and calculated field formulas), so you can see exactly how a Report looked from a given point in time.
A historical run is saved even if the queries in the Report do not complete successfully.
Historical report runs are accessible indefinitely unless the Report is deleted.

You can access a Report's run history from <<report-details,Report details>>.
Click on one of the historical report runs in the list to view the Report as it appeared at that time.
Each historical run has a unique static report run URL so that specific run can be shared with others.

IMPORTANT: {product} only stores query results for historical runs, not the underlying data from your database. When a report is deleted, historical report run results are retained on {product}'s servers for 30 days. After 30 days, historical run results are automatically deleted from {product}'s servers. After an additional 30 days, historical run results are automatically deleted from {product}'s backups and cannot be recovered by {product}.

[#report-builder]
== Report Builder

The Report Builder is a drag-and-drop interface for laying out and adding context to the components of your Report.
When editing a Report, access the Report Builder by clicking on *Report Builder* on the left side of the window.

Common <<report-builder-keyboard-shortcuts,keyboard shortcuts>> are available while editing.
You can re-arrange or re-size your text elements the same way you would any other Report element.
To remove a text box, click on it and then click *Remove* in the toolbar.

To move a component, click and drag it to move it around the layout.
To resize a component, click on it and the drag the grab icons on either side to change its width, or click *Set Height* to adjust its height.
You may choose between *small*, *medium* (the default size), and *large*.
For display tables, you may also set the height to *full* to show up to 1000 records.

IMPORTANT: Any Report content added via the <<html-editor,HTML editor>> (for example, D3 visualizations, HTML elements, etc.) will be visible in the Report Builder, but their size and layout cannot be changed using the drag-and-drop interface.

[#text-boxes]
=== Text boxes

In the Report Builder, you can add text boxes (including text, links, images, and more) to provide more context for your Report:

. In the Report Builder, click *Add Text*.
. Add any text or links.
You can also embed an image.
. When you are finished editing, click anywhere outside the text box to save.

[#html-editor]
== HTML editor

To modify the HTML of a report, click *Edit HTML* at the top of the <<report-builder,Report Builder>>.
After modifying code in the HTML editor, click *Update* to preview your changes.
Any valid HTML can be added to a Report using the HTML editor, including JavaScript inside `<script>` tags and CSS inside `<style>` tags.

image::html-panel.png[The HTML Editor]

The Report's HTML will automatically adjust as you rearrange and resize any of the elements using the drag-and-drop interface.
However, for more fine-grained control over Report layout and styling, or to add advanced visualizations using JavaScript, you must use the <<html-editor,HTML editor>>.

link:https://app.mode.com/modeanalytics/reports/8f9f78bee527[This Report,window=_blank] shows how you can combine various built-in and custom visualizations.
Use the Details tab to view the HTML code and see how it works.

[#layout-grid]
=== Layout grid

Built-in charts (including tables), text boxes, and Notebook visualizations are automatically arranged along a 12-column grid inside a `div` of class `mode-grid container`.
The structure of the HTML is shown below:

[source,html]
----
<div class="mode-grid container">     <!-- The container div for the report grid layout.        -->

  <div class="row">                   <!-- There is a div with class "row" for each row.        -->

    <div class="col-md-7">            <!-- Each chart is inside a div with class "col-md-X".    -->
      <mode-chart ... ></mode-chart>  <!-- X equals the number of columns wide (of 12) the  -->
    </div>                            <!-- chart should be. This chart is 7 of 12 columns wide. -->

    <div class="col-md-5">            <!-- The second chart is 5 columns wide, occupying the    -->
      <mode-chart ... ></mode-chart>  <!-- remaining space in same row as the first chart.       -->
    </div>

  </div>

  <div class="row">                   <!-- This div starts a new row of report components.      -->

    <div class="col-md-12">           <!-- Since this div has the class "col-md-12", the        -->
      <mode-chart ... ></mode-chart>  <!-- component nested within it (a chart) will fill        -->
    </div>                            <!-- the entire row.                                      -->

  </div>

</div>
----

The HTML for the layout grid will update automatically as you modify elements in the drag-and-drop interface of the <<report-builder,Report Builder>>.
However, please note:

* Deleting a reference to a chart or table from the report's HTML will remove it from the layout, but will not delete the underlying chart or table from the report editor.
* You can add custom HTML elements (for example, paragraphs, images, links, etc.) within or outside the grid generated for you by {product}.
Note that adding custom HTML elements within the grid generated for you by {product} (that is, inside the `div` tags with class `mode-grid container`) will result in unexpected behavior, and as such is not recommended at this time.
* We recommend positioning and sizing built-in visualizations with the drag-and-drop interface before modifying the HTML directly, because custom HTML content cannot be modified using the drag-and-drop interface.

The Report's <<name-and-description,name and description>> are automatically added to all Reports inside a `<div>` with the class `mode-header`.
Either can be removed from the layout by deleting them using the HTML editor.
When a Report is embedded, the contents of this `<div>` (including the name and description) will not be rendered in the embed output unless the `embed-hidden` class is removed.

//When a report is xref:white-label-embeds.adoc[embedded], the contents of this `<div>` (including the name and description), will not be rendered in the embed output unless the `embed-hidden` class is removed.

[#external-assets]
=== External assets

You may include external assets (for example, JavaScript libraries, stylesheets, images, JSON files, etc.) in your Report by referencing them via URL with the appropriate tags in the report's HTML.

[NOTE]
====
* Any external assets must be hosted on the internet ({product} does not host custom assets) and loaded securely using HTTPS, _not_ HTTP.
* link:http://d3js.org/[D3,window=_blank] (v3.5.17) and link:http://jquery.com/[JQuery,window=_blank] (v2.2.4), two JavaScript libraries commonly used for data visualization, are preloaded into all {product} reports.
You do not need to add `<script>` tags to your Report to use these libraries.
====

For example, consider the following Population Map report, specifically the link:https://app.mode.com/benn/reports/31baa986cdfd/presentation[HTML code,window=_blank]:

* JavaScript libraries link:https://github.com/mbostock/topojson[TopoJSON,window=_blank] and link:https://underscorejs.org/[Underscore.js,window=_blank] are included at the beginning of the ``<body>``tag.
* A hosted JSON file required to draw the U.S. map is loaded on line 257.

=== Loading state customization

In the HTML editor or in a custom theme, you can target a number of CSS classes to customize elements of a Report's presentation while data is being loaded and visualizations are being rendered:

* `.editor-chart` `.chart-header`: The title of the fully-rendered visualization (charts and notebook output).
* `.mode-placeholder` `.placeholder-title`: The title of the chart placeholder.
* `.mode-placeholder` `.loading-message`: The message appearing in a chart placeholder.
_Default: "`Fetching your data...`" with an animated ellipses._
* `.mode-python` `.loading-message`: The message appearing in the notebook placeholder.
_Default: "`Fetching your notebook data...`" with an animated ellipses._
* `.ph-color-light`: The first of three colors included in the placeholder image that appears in the center of the loading state.
* `.ph-color-medium`: The second of three colors included in the placeholder image that appears in the center of the loading state.
* `.ph-color-dark`: The third color included in the placeholder image that appears in the center of the loading state.
_Note: Only some of the SVGs feature three colors._

== Access query results with JavaScript

Results from any query in your report can be accessed using JavaScript in the HTML editor via the `datasets` array available in any JavaScript scope.
The `content` property of any Dataset within Datasets contains the query results.

If the xref:querying-data.adoc#sorry-this-data-is-larger-than-your-limit[query result exceeds] our legacy limit, the `content` property of the Dataset associated with this query will be empty.
Note that users will still be able to view and create {product} charts and tables in these instances.

The `datasets` array contains the following information for each query in the report:

|===
| Key | Type | Description

| id
| string
| 12 character GUID for the query (equal to `query_token`).

| isLoaded
| boolean
| Is always `true`.

| content[]
| JSON
| The query result set;
one JSON object per row.

| columns[]
| JSON
| Metadata about the columns available in the query result set.

| columns[].type
| string
| Data type of the column at the given position in `columns[]`.

| columns[].name
| string
| Name of the column at the given position in `columns[]`.

| count
| integer
| The number of rows in the query result set.

| state
| string
| `succeeded` if the query successfully ran;
`failed` otherwise.

| queryName
| string
| The given name of the query in {product}.

| reportDataUrl
| string
| URL for viewing the query result set in {product}.

| reportQueryUrl
| string
| URL for viewing the query SQL code in {product}.

| query_token
| string
| 12-character GUID for the query (equal to `id`).

| oversized
| boolean
| Is `true` if the query's results are too large to access in the browser.
If true, `content[]` will be empty.

| csv
| string
| URL for downloading the query result set as a CSV file.
|===

Queries are added to `datasets[]` in the order that they were added to the Report, regardless of the order that they appear in {product}.

=== Example

For example, suppose the first query (named "2006 Oscar Nominees") in a Report returned the following data:

|===
| nominee | category | movie

| Alan Arkin
| actor in a supporting role
| Little Miss Sunshine

| Forest Whitaker
| actor in a leading role
| The Last King of Scotland

| Helen Mirren
| actress in a leading role
| The Queen

| Jennifer Hudson
| actress in a supporting role
| Dreamgirls
|===

Accessing `datasets[0]` would return the following JSON object containing all of the query's results and metadata (use ⊕ and ⊖ to explore).

//{{< renderjson "/other/datasets-demo.json.svg" />

You can see a live example of this Dataset, and learn more about accessing and using the `datasets[]` JSON object, in link:https://app.mode.com/modeanalytics/reports/22bea18bd49e[this example Report,window=_blank].

=== Accessing data by query name

Use the JavaScript link:https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_filter.asp[`filter()` method,window=_blank] to search `datasets[]` and return the result set for that query.
This example declares a new variable (`data`) and sets it equal to the results of a query called "My Query":

[source,javascript]
----
var data = datasets.filter(function(d) { return d.queryName == "My Query"; })[0].content;
----

== Report virtualization

Virtualization, or virtual scrolling, allows the display of a large number of visualizations in a Report by prioritizing displaying only content that is currently visible to the user.
Subsequently, when content is no longer in view, it can be "`detached`" or temporarily hidden, which helps maintain consistent performance regardless of the number of visualizations in the Report.

Virtualization allows us to render Reports with large number of interactive visualizations without causing a significant delay to the display of charts that are immediately visible to the user.
Our virtualized rendering logic will only apply Quick Charts and Visual Explorer charts.

Customization of chart sizes, arrangements, and layouts via CSS, custom JQuery plugins, etc., might result in the virtualization behavior not working correctly.
The following line can be added to the top of the HTML layout `+<!-- no-virtual-scroll -->+` to turn off virtualization if needed.

== Additional options

[#settings]
=== Settings

To access additional Report settings from the Report editor view, click *Report* in the header and select *Settings*:

* *Report Theme:* Applies the selected xref:organizations.adoc#report-themes[theme] to the Report's styling.
* *Full width:* Disabled by default.
When enabled, Report elements will expand to fill the available viewing window.
* *Disable the refresh button from the Report view:* Prevents Report viewers from being able to refresh the Report, including running the Report's queries.
When the button is disabled, Reports can still be run via a schedule or from the editor view by users with edit access to the report.
* *Enable drill anywhere in Report View:* Allow viewers to drill into Visual Explorer and pivot table charts by any field in the underlying data set.
+
image::report-settings-refresh.png[Report Settings]

=== Fullscreen mode

Fullscreen mode maximizes the content of your Report so it occupies the entire screen, eliminating all other parts of the {product} interface and browser window.
A Report in fullscreen mode will automatically refresh and display the latest data whenever the Report is successfully run unless you access it using a static xref:report-scheduling-and-sharing.adoc#link[run link].
To enable fullscreen mode:

. In the Report header, click *Fullscreen* (this option may be in the *More* menu).
. Your Report will expand to fill the screen.
Only the margins of the Report will expand.
The Report elements themselves will not.
To include more elements in your dashboard, enable full width mode in <<settings,Report settings>>.
. To exit fullscreen mode, press the *Escape* key.
+
TIP: Don't see the **Fullscreen** button in the Report header? You may be in the Report editor. Click **View** in the Report header and repeat the above steps.

[#url-query-string]
=== URL query string
//+++<flag-icon>++++++</flag-icon>+++

You may add one or more field-value pairs to an {product} Report's URL link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string[query string,window=_blank] to control that Report's behavior.
You may combine multiple field-value pairs in a Report's URL query string, separated by `&`.

TIP: All {product} URLs, including query strings, are case-sensitive.

==== `run`

Forces the Report to re-run and refreshes all query results, Notebook output, and visualizations.

* If present in the query string, must be equal to the value `now`.
* Whenever a Report URL is accessed that includes `run=now` in the query string, the report will re-run.
If `run=now` is not included in the query string, {product} will return data from the most recent time the report was run.
* If the URL query string includes values for xref:parameters.adoc[Parameters], then the Report will be run each time the URL is accessed, even if `run=now` is not included.

The following example URL will update all queries and visualizations each time it is accessed:

[source,http]
----
https://app.mode.com/benn/reports/31baa986cdfd?run=now
----

==== `param_[PARAMETER_NAME]`

Specifies the value that should be used for a given Report xref:parameters.adoc[Parameter] of `[PARAMETER_NAME]`.

* Parameter names and values in Report URLs are case-sensitive.
* Remember to link:https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp[URL-encode any special characters,window=_blank] used in your Parameter names or values.
* If no value or an invalid value is provided for a Parameter in the URL query string, the value of the `default` property in the Parameter definition will be used.
* For xref:parameters.adoc#multiselect[multiselect] Parameters, each distinct value must be provided as a separate field-value pair in the format `param_[PARAM_NAME][]=[PARAM_VALUE]`.
+
TIP: Use '_' to denote spaces instead of '+'.

The following example URL will run the target report with "Midwest" and "Northeast" selected for the `sales_region` multiselect Parameter and "2000" as the value for the `order_max` text Parameter:

[source,http]
----
https://app.mode.com/modeanalytics/reports/a9e1fe690f93?param_sales_region[]=Midwest&param_sales_region[]=Northeast&param_order_max=2000
