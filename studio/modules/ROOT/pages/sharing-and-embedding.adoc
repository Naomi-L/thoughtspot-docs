== Sharing

Admins can control how members of their Workspace are able to share Reports both internally and externally:

. Navigate to the link:https://app.mode.com/home/[{brand} home page,window=_blank], click on your name in the upper left corner of the screen, and select *Workspace Settings* from the dropdown menu.
. Click on *Sharing & Embedding* under Features.

Adjust the toggles next to each of the following options and click *Save settings* when you are done to confirm:

[discrete]
=== Allow external sharing of reports
//+++<flag-icon>++++++</flag-icon>+++

Disabled by default.
External sharing must be enabled in Workspace Settings before anyone can share Reports outside of your Workspace.
Enabling external sharing in Workspace Settings will *not* cause any Reports or data to be shared;
external sharing must be enabled for each individual Report.

Disabling this setting will immediately cause all xref:report-scheduling-and-sharing.adoc#link[external links] to all Reports in your Workspace to stop functioning and return a `404 - Not Found` error.
Any Reports which previously had external sharing enabled will therefore become inaccessible to viewers who are not logged-in members of your Workspace.

If you are an admin of {brand}'s paid plan Workspace and you do not see the setting to enable External Sharing, it may not be included as part of your paid agreement.
xref:contact-us.adoc[Contact our success team] to learn more.

[discrete]
==== Allow data previews, PDFs, and CSVs to be included in emails and Slack messages

Enabled by default.
When disabled, Report image previews will no longer appear the message bodies of Slack or email shares, and Reports shared via email can no longer contain attached PDFs or CSVs.

[discrete]
=== Allow users to access and move reports into your Workspace's Community space

Disabled by default.
Enable to make the xref:spaces.adoc#community-space[community Collection] visible to all members of your Workspace and allow users to move Reports into it.
Hiding the community Collection will not delete Reports already inside it.
Reports already in the community Collection will still exist and will be available via URL or discoverable through {brand} search.
However, members will not be able to move any new Reports into the community Collection.

[discrete]
=== Require transport encryption for emails

Disabled by default.
Enable this feature to prevent {brand} from being able to send emails related to your Workspace, such as when members share via email, to servers that don't have transport encryption enabled.

== Embedding

[#white-label-embed-signature-tokens]
=== White-Label Embed signature tokens

You must use a valid signature token for your {brand} Workspace to successfully generate a signature for a White-Label Embed URL.
Signature tokens can only be created by a Workspace admin.
To create or modify a signature token:

. Click on *Sharing & Embedding* under Features.
. Click on the *Embedding* tab.
. To create a new signature token, enter a unique name and click *Create token*.
The new token's public *access key* and private *access secret* will appear.
. To rename or invalidate a signature token, click *Edit* next to its name in the list.

WARNING: Remember to store the access secret securely. Do not expose the access secret on public sites, in client-side code, or in public code repositories.

== Slack integration

NOTE: {brand} will be sunsetting the legacy Slack integration in September 2022. To upgrade your workspace to the latest Slack integration version, follow the instructions xref:slack.adoc[here].

The link:https://slack.com/apps/A1KBFDRGR-mode[{brand} Slack app,window=_blank] enables members of your Workspace to link:https://mode.com/integrations/slack/[share reports via Slack,window=_blank] directly from {brand}.
Set up your xref:slack.adoc#setting-up[Slack Integration] today and xref:report-scheduling-and-sharing.adoc#slack[start sharing].
